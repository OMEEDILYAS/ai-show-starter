In Section 4.1, we saw that the determinant can be used to compute the area of a parallelogram. If we are given two vectors b = [1,0](cid:62), 1 b = [0,1](cid:62) asthesidesoftheunitsquare(blue;seeFigure5.5),thearea 2 ofthissquareis (cid:12) (cid:18)(cid:20) (cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:12) (cid:12) 1 0 (cid:12) (cid:12)det (cid:12) = 1.

We can find this scaling factor by finding a mapping that transforms the unit square into the other square. In linear algebra terms, we effectively perform a variable transformation from (b ,b ) to (c ,c ). In our case, 1 2 1 2 the mapping is linear and the absolute value of the determinant of this mappinggivesusexactlythescalingfactorwearelookingfor. We will describe two approaches to identify this mapping. First, we exploitthatthemappingislinearsothatwecanusethetoolsfromChapter2 to identify this mapping. Second, we will find the mapping using partial derivativesusingthetoolswehavebeendiscussinginthischapter. Approach 1 To get started with the linear algebra approach, we identify both b ,b and c ,c as bases of R2 (see Section 2.6.1 for a 1 2 1 2 { } { } recap). What we effectively perform is a change of basis from (b ,b ) to 1 2 (c ,c ),andwearelookingforthetransformationmatrixthatimplements 1 2 thebasischange.UsingresultsfromSection2.7.2,weidentifythedesired basischangematrixas (cid:20) (cid:21) 2 1 J = − , (5.62) 1 1 such that Jb = c and Jb = c .
