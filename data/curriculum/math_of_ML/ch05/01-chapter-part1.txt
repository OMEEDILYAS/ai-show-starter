Examples include: (i) linear regression (see Chapter 9), where we look at curve-fitting problems and optimize linear weight parameters to maximize the likelihood; (ii) neural-networkauto-encodersfordimensionalityreductionanddatacompression, where the parameters are the weights and biases of each layer, andwhereweminimizeareconstructionerrorbyrepeatedapplicationof the chain rule; and (iii) Gaussian mixture models (see Chapter 11) for modeling data distributions, where we optimize the location and shape parameters of each mixture component to maximize the likelihood of the model. Figure 5.1 illustrates some of these problems, which we typically solve by using optimization algorithms that exploit gradient information (Section 7.1). Figure 5.2 gives an overview of how concepts in this chapterarerelatedandhowtheyareconnectedtootherchaptersofthebook. Central to this chapter is the concept of a function. A function f is a quantity that relates two quantities to each other. In this book, these quantitiesaretypicallyinputsx RD andtargets(functionvalues)f(x), which we assume are real-value ∈ d if not stated otherwise. Here RD is the domain of f, and the function values f(x) are the image/codomain of f. domain image/codomain Figure5.1 Vector 4 calculusplaysa centralrolein(a) 2 regression(curve fitting)and(b) 0 densityestimation, 2 i.e.,modelingdata − distributions. 4 − 4 2 0 2 4 − − x y 10 Trainingdata MLE 5 0 5 − 10 − 10 5 0 5 10 − − x1 (a) Regression problem: Find parameters, such that the curve explains the observations (crosses)well. 2x (b)DensityestimationwithaGaussianmixture model: Find means and covariances, such that thedata(dots)canbeexplainedwell. 139 ThismaterialwillbepublishedbyCambridgeUniversityPressasMathematicsforMachineLearningbyMarcPeterDeisenroth,A.AldoFaisal,andChengSoonOng.Thispre-publicationversionis freetoviewanddownloadforpersonaluseonly.Notforre-distribution,re-saleoruseinderivativeworks.(cid:13)cbyM.P.Deisenroth,A.A.Faisal,andC.S.Ong,2019.https://mml-book.com. 140 VectorCalculus Figure5.2 Amind Chapter9 Differencequotient mapoftheconcepts Regression introducedinthis chapter,alongwith whentheyareused inotherpartsofthe book.

Throughout this book, we assume that functions are differentiable. With some additional technical definitions, which we do not cover here, many of the approaches presented can be extended to sub-differentials (functions that are continuous but not
