Since B is the standard basis, the coordinate representation is straightforward to find. For a general basis B, we would need to solve a linear equation system to find the λ such that i (cid:13)c2019M.P.Deisenroth,A.A.Faisal,C.S.Ong.TobepublishedbyCambridgeUniversityPress. 58 LinearAlgebra (cid:80)3 λ b = b˜ ,j = 1,...,3.Similarly,thejthcolumnofT isthecoordii=1 i i j naterepresentationofc˜ intermsofthebasisvectorsofC. j Therefore,weobtain    1 1 1 1 3 2 1 − − A˜ Φ = T−1A Φ S = 2 1    1 1 − 1 1 1 1 − 1 1     1 0 0 4 8 2 4    (2.121a) − 0 0 0 2 1 6 3   4 4 2 − − −  6 0 0  =  .

In the following, we will characterize them morecarefully.

An illustration is given in Figure2.12. Remark. Consider a linear mapping Φ : V W, where V,W are vector → spaces. It always holds that Φ(0 ) = 0 and, therefore,
