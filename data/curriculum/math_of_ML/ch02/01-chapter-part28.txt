Moreover, we will briefly discuss properties of mappings between these affine spaces, whichresemblelinearmappings. Remark. Inthemachinelearningliterature,thedistinctionbetweenlinear and affine is sometimes not clear so that we can find references to affine spaces/mappingsaslinearspaces/mappings. ♦ 2.8.1 Affine Subspaces Definition 2.25 (Affine Subspace). Let V be a vector space, x V and 0 ∈ U V asubspace.Thenthesubset ⊆ L = x +U := x +u : u U (2.130a) 0 0 { ∈ } = v V u U : v = x +u V (2.130b) 0 { ∈ |∃ ∈ } ⊆ is called affine subspace or linear manifold of V. U is called direction or affinesubspace direction space, and x 0 is called support point. In Chapter 12, we refer to linearmanifold suchasubspaceasahyperplane. direction directionspace Note that the definition of an affine subspace excludes 0 if x 0 / U. supportpoint ∈ Therefore,anaffinesubspaceisnota(linear)subspace(vectorsubspace) hyperplane ofV forx / U. 0 Examples ∈ ofaffinesubspacesarepoints,lines,andplanesinR3,which donot(necessarily)gothroughtheorigin.

This means that a line is ⊆ defined by a support point x and a vector x that defines the direction. See Fig0 1 ure2.13foranillustration.
