Thus far, we saw that matrices can be used as a compact way of formulating systems of linear equations so that we can write Ax = b, see (2.10). Moreover, we defined basic matrix operations, such as addition and multiplication of matrices. In the following, we will focusonsolvingsystemsoflinearequationsandprovideanalgorithmfor findingtheinverseofamatrix. 2.3.1 Particular and General Solution Before discussing how to generally solve systems of linear equations, let ushavealookatanexample.Considerthesystemofequations   x 1 (cid:20) (cid:21) (cid:20) (cid:21) 1 0 8 − 4   x 2  = 42 .

This system of equations is in a particularly easy form, where the first two columns consist of a 1 and a 0.
