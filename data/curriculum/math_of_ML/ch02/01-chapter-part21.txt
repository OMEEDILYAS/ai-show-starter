Theorem2.17(Theorem3.59inAxler(2015)). Finite-dimensionalvector spacesV andW areisomorphicifandonlyifdim(V) = dim(W). Theorem 2.17 states that there exists a linear, bijective mapping between two vector spaces of the same dimension. Intuitively, this means that vector spaces of the same dimension are kind of the same thing, as theycanbetransformedintoeachotherwithoutincurringanyloss. Theorem 2.17 also gives us the justification to treat Rm×n (the vector space of m n-matrices) and Rmn (the vector space of vectors of length × mn) the same, as their dimensions are mn, and there exists a linear, bijectivemappingthattransformsoneintotheother.

In this coordinate system, a vector x R2 1 2 ∈ has a representation that tells us how to linearly combine e and e to 1 2 obtain x. However, any basis of R2 defines a valid coordinate system, and the same vector x from before may have a different coordinate representation in the (b ,b ) basis.
