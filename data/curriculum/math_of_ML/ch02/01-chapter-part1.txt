2 Linear Algebra Whenformalizingintuitiveconcepts,acommonapproachistoconstructa setofobjects(symbols)andasetofrulestomanipulatetheseobjects.This is known as an algebra. Linear algebra is the study of vectors and certain algebra rulestomanipulatevectors.Thevectorsmanyofusknowfromschoolare called “geometric vectors”, which are usually denoted by a small arrow above the letter, e.g., x and y. In this book, we discuss more general →− →− conceptsofvectorsanduseaboldlettertorepresentthem,e.g.,xandy. In general, vectors are special objects that can be added together and multiplied by scalars to produce another object of the same kind. From an abstract mathematical viewpoint, any object that satisfies these two properties can be considered a vector. Here are some examples of such vectorobjects: 1. Geometricvectors.Thisexampleofavectormaybefamiliarfromhigh schoolmathematicsandphysics.Geometricvectors–seeFigure2.1(a) – are directed segments, which can be drawn (at least in two dimen- → → → → → sions).Twogeometricvectorsx, y canbeadded,suchthatx+y = z is another geometric vector. Furthermore, multiplication by a scalar λ → x, λ R, is also a geometric vector. In fact, it is the original vector ∈ scaled by λ. Therefore, geometric vectors are instances of the vector concepts introduced previously. Interpreting vectors as geometric vectors enables us to use our intuitions about direction and magnitude to reasonaboutmathematicaloperations. 2.

Notethatpolynomialsareverydifferentfromgeometricvectors.While geometric vectors are concrete “drawings”, polynomials are abstract concepts. However, they are both vectors in the sense previously described. 3. Audio signals are vectors. Audio signals are represented as a series of numbers. We can add audio signals together, and their sum is a new audiosignal.Ifwescaleanaudiosignal,wealsoobtainanaudiosignal. Therefore,audiosignalsareatypeofvector,too. 4. Elements of Rn (tuples of n real numbers) are vectors. Rn is more abstract than polynomials, and it is the concept we focus on in this book.Forinstance,   1 a = 2 R3 (2.1) ∈ 3 is an example of a triplet of numbers. Adding two vectors a,b Rn component-wise resultsin anothervector: a+b = c Rn. More ∈ over, multiplying a Rn by λ R results in a scaled v ∈ ector λa Rn.

Linear algebra focuses on the similarities between these vector concepts. We can add them together and multiply them by scalars.
