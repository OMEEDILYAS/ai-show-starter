In particular, the solution of the linear equation − λ x +...+λ x = b, where (λ ,...,λ ) = (0,...,0), is a hyperplane 1 1 n n 1 n inRn. (cid:54) In Rn, every k-dimensional affine subspace is the solution of a linear inhomogeneousequationsystemAx = b,whereA Rm×n,b Rm and ∈ ∈ rk(A) = n k.

Affine mappings keep the geometric structure invariant. They also preservethedimensionandparallelism. 2.9 Further Reading There are many resources for learning linear algebra, including the textbooks by Strang (2003), Golan (2007), Axler (2015), and Liesen and Mehrmann (2015). There are also several online resources that we mentionedintheintroductiontothischapter.WeonlycoveredGaussianelimination here, but there are many other approaches for solving systems of linear equations, and we refer to numerical linear algebra textbooks by Stoer and Burlirsch (2002), Golub and Van Loan (2012), and Horn and Johnson(2013)foranin-depthdiscussion. In this book, we distinguish between the topics of linear algebra (e.g., vectors, matrices, linear independence, basis) and topics related to the geometry of a vector space. In Chapter 3, we will introduce the inner product,whichinducesanorm.Theseconceptsallowustodefineangles, lengths and distances, which we will use for orthogonal projections. Projections turn out to be key in many machine learning algorithms, such as linearregressionandprincipalcomponentanalysis,bothofwhichwewill coverinChapters9and10,respectively.
