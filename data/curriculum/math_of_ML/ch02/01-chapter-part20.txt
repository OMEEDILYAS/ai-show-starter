Later, we will call this subspace the kernel or the null kernel − space. nullspace A matrix A Rm×n has full rank if its rank equals the largest possible fullrank ∈ rank for a matrix of the same dimensions.

Inthebeginningofthechapter,wesaidthatvectorsareobjectsthatcanbe added together and multiplied by a scalar, and the resulting object is still a vector. We wish to preserve this property when applying the mapping: Consider two real vector spaces V,W. A mapping Φ : V W preserves → thestructureofthevectorspaceif Φ(x+y) = Φ(x)+Φ(y) (2.85) Φ(λx) = λΦ(x) (2.86) for all x,y V and λ R. We can summarize this in the following ∈ ∈ definition: Definition 2.15 (Linear Mapping). For vector spaces V,W, a mapping linearmapping Φ : V W is called a linear mapping (or vector space homomorphism/ → vectorspace lineartransformation)if homomorphism x,y V λ,ψ R : Φ(λx+ψy) = λΦ(x)+ψΦ(y). (2.87) linear ∀ ∈ ∀ ∈ transformation It turns out that we can represent linear mappings as matrices (Section2.7.1).Recallthatwecanalsocollectasetofvectorsascolumnsofa matrix. When working with matrices, we have to keep in mind what the matrixrepresents:alinearmappingoracollectionofvectors.Wewillsee more about linear mappings in Chapter 4.

A bijective Φ can be “undone”, i.e., there exists a mapping Ψ : so that Ψ Φ(x) = x. This mapping Ψ is then called the inverse W → V ◦ ofΦandnormallydenotedbyΦ−1.
