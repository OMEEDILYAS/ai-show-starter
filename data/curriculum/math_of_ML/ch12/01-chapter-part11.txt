This is called the convex hull and is illustratedinFigure12.9. Let us first build some intuition about a convex combination of points. Consider two points x and x and corresponding non-negative weights 1 2 α ,α (cid:62) 0suchthatα +α = 1.Theequationα x +α x describeseach 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 pointonalinebetweenx andx .Considerwhathappenswhenweadd 1 2 a third point x along with a weight α (cid:62) 0 such that (cid:80)3 α = 1. 3 3 n=1 n The convex combination of these three points x ,x ,x spans a two1 2 3 convexhull dimensional area. The convex hull of this area is the triangle formed by theedgescorrespondingtoeachpairofofpoints.Asweaddmorepoints, and the number of points becomes greater than the number of dimensions, some of the points will be inside the convex hull, as we can see in Figure12.9(a). In general, building a convex convex hull can be done by introducing non-negative weights α (cid:62) 0 corresponding to each example x .
