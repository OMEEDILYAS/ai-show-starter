6 Probability and Distributions Probability, loosely speaking, concerns the study of uncertainty.

As mentioned inChapter1,weoftenquantifyuncertaintyinthedata,uncertaintyinthe machine learning model, and uncertainty in the predictions produced by randomvariable themodel.Quantifyinguncertaintyrequirestheideaofarandomvariable, whichisafunctionthatmapsoutcomesofrandomexperimentstoasetof properties that we are interested in. Associated with the random variable is a function that measures the probability that a particular outcome (or probability setofoutcomes)willoccur;thisiscalledtheprobabilitydistribution. distribution Probability distributions are used as a building block for other concepts,suchasprobabilisticmodeling(Section8.4),graphicalmodels(Section8.5),andmodelselection(Section8.6).Inthenextsection,wepresent the three concepts that define a probability space (the sample space, the events, and the probability of an event) and how they are related to a fourth concept called the random variable. The presentation is deliberately slightly hand wavy since a rigorous presentation may occlude the intuitionbehindtheconcepts.Anoutlineoftheconceptspresentedinthis chapterareshowninFigure6.1. 6.1 Construction of a Probability Space The theory of probability aims at defining a mathematical structure to describe random outcomes of experiments. For example, when tossing a singlecoin,wecannotdeterminetheoutcome,butbydoingalargenumber of coin tosses, we can observe a regularity in the average outcome. Using this mathematical structure of probability, the goal is to perform automated reasoning, and in this sense, probability generalizes logical reasoning(Jaynes,2003). 6.1.1 Philosophical Issues When constructing automated reasoning systems, classical Boolean logic doesnotallowustoexpresscertainformsofplausiblereasoning.Consider 172 ThismaterialwillbepublishedbyCambridgeUniversityPressasMathematicsforMachineLearningbyMarcPeterDeisenroth,A.AldoFaisal,andChengSoonOng.Thispre-publicationversionis freetoviewanddownloadforpersonaluseonly.Notforre-distribution,re-saleoruseinderivativeworks.(cid:13)cbyM.P.Deisenroth,A.A.Faisal,andC.S.Ong,2019.https://mml-book.com. 6.1 ConstructionofaProbabilitySpace 173 Figure6.1 Amind Mean Variance Bayes’Theorem mapoftheconcepts relatedtorandom variablesand probability distributions,as Chapter9 describedinthis Summarystatistics Productrule Sumrule Regression chapter.

We find B becomes less plausible, although no conclusion can be drawn from classical logic. We observe that B is true. It seems A becomes more plausible. We use this form of reasoning daily. We are waiting for a friend, and consider threepossibilities:H1,sheisontime;H2,shehasbeendelayedbytraffic; and H3, she has been abducted by aliens. When we observe our friend is late, we must logically rule out H1. We also tend to consider H2 to be morelikely,thoughwearenotlogicallyrequiredtodoso.Finally,wemay consider H3 to be possible, but we continue to consider it quite unlikely. How do we conclude H2 is the most plausible answer?

Another way to think about it is that if we are precise about our common sense we end up constructing probabilities. E. T. Jaynes (1922–1998) identified three mathematical criteria, which mustapplytoallplausibilities: 1. Thedegreesofplausibilityarerepresentedbyrealnumbers. 2.

The resulting reasoning must be consistent, with the three following meaningsoftheword“consistent”: (a) Consistency or non-contradiction: When the same result can be reachedthroughdifferentmeans,thesameplausibilityvaluemust befoundinallcases. (b) Honesty:Allavailabledatamustbetakenintoaccount. (c) Reproducibility:Ifourstateofknowledgeabouttwoproblemsare the same, then we must assign the same degree of plausibility to bothofthem. The Cox–Jaynes theorem proves these plausibilities to be sufficient to define the
