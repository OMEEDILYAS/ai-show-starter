8 When Models Meet Data In the first part of the book, we introduced the mathematics that form the foundations of many machine learning methods. The hope is that a reader would be able to learn the rudimentary forms of the language of mathematics from the first part, which we will now use to describe and discuss machine learning. The second part of the book introduces four pillarsofmachinelearning: Regression(Chapter9) Dimensionalityreduction(Chapter10) Densityestimation(Chapter11) Classification(Chapter12) Themainaimofthispartofthebookistoillustratehowthemathematical concepts introduced in the first part of the book can be used to design machine learning algorithms that can be used to solve tasks within the remitofthefourpillars.Wedonotintendtointroduceadvancedmachine learning concepts, but instead to provide a set of practical methods that allow the reader to apply the knowledge they gained from the first part of the book. It also provides a gateway to the wider machine learning literatureforreadersalreadyfamiliarwiththemathematics. 8.1 Data, Models, and Learning It is worth at this point, to pause and consider the problem that a machine learning algorithm is designed to solve. As discussed in Chapter 1, there are three major components of a machine learning system: data, models,andlearning.Themainquestionofmachinelearningis“Whatdo wemeanbygoodmodels?”.Thewordmodelhasmanysubtleties,andwe model will revisit it multiple times in this chapter. It is also not entirely obvious how to objectively define the word “good”. One of the guiding principles of machine learning is that good models should perform well on unseen data. This requires us to define some performance metrics, such as accuracyordistancefromgroundtruth,aswellasfiguringoutwaystodowell undertheseperformancemetrics.Thischaptercoversafewnecessarybits and pieces of mathematical and statistical language that are commonly 251 ThismaterialwillbepublishedbyCambridgeUniversityPressasMathematicsforMachineLearningbyMarcPeterDeisenroth,A.AldoFaisal,andChengSoonOng.Thispre-publicationversionis freetoviewanddownloadforpersonaluseonly.Notforre-distribution,re-saleoruseinderivativeworks.(cid:13)cbyM.P.Deisenroth,A.A.Faisal,andC.S.Ong,2019.https://mml-book.com. 252 WhenModelsMeetData Table8.1 Example Name Gender Degree Postcode Age Annualsalary datafroma Aditya M MSc W21BG 36 89563 fictitioushuman Bob M PhD EC1A1BA 47 123543 resourcedatabase Chlo´e F BEcon SW1A1BH 26 23989 thatisnotina Daisuke M BSc SE207AT 68 138769 numericalformat.

By doing so, we briefly outlinethecurrentbestpracticesfortrainingamodelsuchthattheresulting predictordoeswellondatathatwehavenotyetseen. As mentioned in Chapter 1, there are two different senses in which we usethephrase“machinelearningalgorithm”:trainingandprediction.We will describe these ideas in this chapter, as well as the idea of selecting among different models. We will introduce the framework of empirical risk minimization in Section 8.2, the principle of maximum likelihood in Section8.3,andtheideaofprobabilisticmodelsinSection8.4.Webriefly outline a graphical language for specifying probabilistic models in Section8.5andfinallydiscussmodelselectioninSection8.6.Therestofthis section expands upon the three main components of machine learning: data,modelsandlearning. 8.1.1 Data as Vectors Weassumethatourdatacanbereadbyacomputer,andrepresentedadequatelyinanumericalformat.Dataisassumedtobetabular(Figure8.1), where we think of each row of the table as representing a particular inDataisassumedto stance or example, and each column to be a particular feature.

Even when we have data in tabular format, there are still choices to be madetoobtainanumericalrepresentation.Forexample,inTable8.1,the gender column (a categorical variable) may be converted into numbers 0 representing “Male” and 1 representing “Female”. Alternatively, the gender could be represented by numbers 1,+1, respectively (as shown in − Table 8.2). Furthermore, it is often important to use domain knowledge when constructing the representation,
