Even numerical data that could potentially be directly read into a machine learning algorithm should be carefully consideredforunits,scaling,andconstraints.Withoutadditionalinformation, one should shift and scale all columns of the dataset such that they have an empirical mean of 0 and an empirical variance of 1. For the purposes of this book, we assume that a domain expert already converted data appropriately,i.e.,eachinputx isaD-dimensionalvectorofrealnumbers, n whicharecalledfeatures,attributes,orcovariates.Weconsideradatasetto feature be of the form as illustrated by Table 8.2.

In this part of the book, we will use N to denote the number of examples in a dataset and index the examples with lowercase n = 1,...,N. We assume that we are given a set of numerical data, represented as an array of vectors (Table 8.2). Each row is a particular individual x , often n referredtoasanexampleordatapointinmachinelearning.Thesubscript example n refers to the fact that this is the nth example out of a total of N exam- datapoint plesinthedataset.Eachcolumnrepresentsaparticularfeatureofinterest abouttheexample,andweindexthefeaturesasd = 1,...,D.Recallthat dataisrepresentedasvectors,whichmeansthateachexample(eachdata point) is a D-dimensional vector. The orientation of the table originates from the database community, but for some machine learning algorithms (e.g., in Chapter 10) it is more convenient to represent examples as columnvectors. Letusconsidertheproblemofpredictingannualsalaryfromage,based on the data in Table 8.2. This is called a supervised learning problem where we have a label y n (the salary) associated with each example x n label (the age). The label y has various other names, including target, ren sponse variable, and annotation. A dataset is written as a set of examplelabel pairs (x ,y ),...,(x ,y ),...,(x ,y ) .
