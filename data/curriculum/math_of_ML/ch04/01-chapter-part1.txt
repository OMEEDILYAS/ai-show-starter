We first consider methods that allow us to describe matrices with just a few numbers that characterize the overall properties of matrices. We will do this in the sections on determinants (Section 4.1) and eigenvalues(Section4.2)fortheimportantspecialcaseofsquarematrices.These characteristic numbers have important mathematical consequences and allow us to quickly grasp what useful properties a matrix has. From here we will proceed to matrix decomposition methods: An analogy for matrix decomposition is the factoring of numbers, such as the factoring of 21 into prime numbers 7 3. For this reason matrix decomposition is also · matrixfactorization often referred to as matrix factorization. Matrix decompositions are used to describe a matrix by means of a different representation using factors ofinterpretablematrices. We will first cover a square-root-like operation for symmetric, positive definite matrices, the Cholesky decomposition (Section 4.3). From here we will look at two related methods for factorizing matrices into canonical forms. The first one is known as matrix diagonalization (Section 4.4), which allows us to represent the linear mapping using a diagonal transformation matrix if we choose an appropriate basis. The second method, singular value decomposition (Section 4.5), extends this factorization to non-squarematrices,anditisconsideredoneofthefundamentalconcepts inlinearalgebra.Thesedecompositionsarehelpful,asmatricesrepresentingnumericaldataareoftenverylargeandhardtoanalyze.Weconclude the chapter with a systematic overview of the types of matrices and the characteristicpropertiesthatdistinguishthemintheformofamatrixtaxonomy(Section4.7).

A determinant is notation|A|must a mathematical object in the analysis and solution of systems of linear notbeconfused equations.
