Given a matrix A Rm×n, we can always obtain a symmetric,positivesemidefinitematrixS ∈ Rn×n bydefining ∈ S := A(cid:62)A. (4.36) Remark. If rk(A) = n, then S := A(cid:62)A is symmetric, positive definite. ♦ Understanding why Theorem 4.14 holds is insightful for how we can use symmetrized matrices: Symmetry requires S = S(cid:62), and by inserting (4.36) we obtain S = A(cid:62)A = A(cid:62)(A(cid:62))(cid:62) = (A(cid:62)A)(cid:62) = S(cid:62). Moreover, positive semidefiniteness (Section 3.2.3) requires that x(cid:62)Sx (cid:62) 0 and inserting (4.36) we obtain x(cid:62)Sx = x(cid:62)A(cid:62)Ax = (x(cid:62)A(cid:62))(Ax) = (Ax)(cid:62)(Ax) (cid:62) 0, because the dot product computes a sum of squares (whicharethemselvesnon-negative). spectraltheorem Theorem 4.15 (Spectral Theorem). If A Rn×n is symmetric, there ex- ∈ ists an orthonormal basis of the corresponding vector space V consisting of eigenvectorsofA,andeacheigenvalueisreal. A direct implication of the spectral theorem is that the eigendecomposition of a symmetric matrix A exists (with real eigenvalues), and that we can find an ONB of eigenvectors so that A = PDP(cid:62), where D is diagonalandthecolumnsofP containtheeigenvectors.

However, since x(cid:62)x = 3 1 2 1 2 1 = 0, they are not orthogonal. The spectral theorem (Theorem 4.15) (cid:54) states that there exists an orthogonal basis, but the one we have is not orthogonal.However,wecanconstructone.
