Remark. Orthogonality is the generalization of the concept of perpendicularity to bilinear forms that do not have to be the dot product. In our context, geometrically, we can think of orthogonal vectors as having a rightanglewithrespecttoaspecificinnerproduct. ♦ Example 3.7 (Orthogonal Vectors) Figure3.6 The 1 angleωbetween y x twovectorsx,ycan changedepending ω ontheinner product. −1 0 1 Consider two vectors x = [1,1](cid:62),y = [ 1,1](cid:62) R2; see Figure 3.6. − ∈ We are interested in determining the angle ω between them using two differentinnerproducts.Usingthedotproductastheinnerproductyields an angle ω between x and y of 90◦, such that x y.

This means that orthogonal matrices A with A(cid:62) = A−1 preserve both angles and distances. It turns out that orthogonal matrices define transformations that are rotations (with the possibility of flips). In Section 3.9, we will discuss more detailsaboutrotations. 3.5 Orthonormal Basis In Section 2.6.1, we characterized properties of basis vectors and found that in an n-dimensional vector space, we need n basis vectors, i.e., n vectors that are linearly independent. In Sections 3.3 and 3.4, we used inner products to compute the length of vectors and the angle between vectors. In the following, we will discuss the special case where the basis vectors are orthogonal to each other and where the length of each basis vectoris1.Wewillcallthisbasisthenanorthonormalbasis.
