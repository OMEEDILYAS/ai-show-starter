This will play an important role in Chapter 10, when we discuss linear dimensionality reduction from a geometric perspective. Consider a D-dimensional vector space V and an M-dimensional subspaceU V.ThenitsorthogonalcomplementU⊥isa(D M)-dimensional orthogonal ⊆ − subspace of V and contains all vectors in V that are orthogonal to every complement vectorinU.Furthermore,U U⊥ = 0 sothatanyvectorx V canbe ∩ { } ∈ (cid:13)c2019M.P.Deisenroth,A.A.Faisal,C.S.Ong.TobepublishedbyCambridgeUniversityPress. 80 AnalyticGeometry Figure3.7 Aplane e U ina 3 three-dimensional vectorspacecanbe w describedbyits normalvector, e whichspansits 2 orthogonal complementU⊥. e 1 U uniquelydecomposedinto M D−M (cid:88) (cid:88) x = λ b + ψ b⊥, λ , ψ R, (3.36) m m j j m j ∈ m=1 j=1 where(b ,...,b )isabasisofU and(b⊥,...,b⊥ )isabasisofU⊥. 1 M 1 D−M Therefore, the orthogonal complement can also be used to describe a planeU (two-dimensionalsubspace)inathree-dimensionalvectorspace. More specifically, the vector w with w = 1, which is orthogonal to the (cid:107) (cid:107) plane U, is the basis vector of U⊥. Figure 3.7 illustrates this setting. All vectors that are orthogonal to w must (by construction) lie in the plane normalvector U.Thevectorw iscalledthenormalvectorofU. Generally,orthogonalcomplementscanbeusedtodescribehyperplanes inn-dimensionalvectorandaffinespaces. 3.7 Inner Product of Functions Thus far, we looked at properties of inner products to compute lengths, angles and distances. We focused on inner products of finite-dimensional vectors. In the following, we will look at an example of inner products of adifferenttypeofvectors:innerproductsoffunctions. The inner products we discussed so far were defined for vectors with a finitenumberofentries.Wecanthinkofavectorx Rn asfunctionwith ∈ n function values. The concept of an inner product can be generalized to vectors with an infinite number of entries (countably infinite) and also continuous-valued functions (uncountably infinite). Then the sum over individual components of vectors (see Equation (3.5) for example) turns intoanintegral.
