For every Nash equilibrium, we can construct an equivalentcorrelated equilibrium,inthesensethattheyinducethesamedistributiononoutcomes. Theorem3.4.13 ForeveryNashequilibriumσ∗ thereexistsacorrespondingcorrelatedequilibriumσ. Theproofisstraightforward.Roughly,wecanconstructacorrelatedequilibrium fromagivenNashequilibriumbylettingeachD = A andlettingthejointprobi i ability distribution be π(d) = σ∗(d ). Then we chooseσ as the mapping i∈N i i i from each d to the corresponding a . When the agents play the strategy profile i i σ, the distribution over outcom Q es is identical to that under σ∗. Because the v ’s i are uncorrelatedand no agentcan benefitby deviating from σ∗, σ is a correlated equilibrium.

Thus, if the set of correlated equilibria of a game G does not contain a single element, it is infinite. Indeed, any convex combination of correlatedequilibriumpayoffscan itself be realizedas the payoffprofile ofsome correlated equilibrium.
