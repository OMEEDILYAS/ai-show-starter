Butusingtheaforementionedprocedure,thereadercanverifythatagainthereexistsamixed-strategy equilibrium;inthiscase,eachplayerchoosesoneofthetwoavailableactionswith probability1/2. Whatdoesitmeantosaythatanagentplaysamixed-strategyNashequilibrium? Do players really sample probability distributions in their heads? Some people have argued that they really do. One well-known motivating example for mixed strategies involves soccer: specifically, a kicker and a goalie getting ready for a penaltykick. The kickercankicktothe leftorthe right, andthegoaliecanjump to the left or the right. The kicker scores if and only if he kicks to one side and thegoaliejumpstotheother;thisisthusbestmodeledasMatchingPennies.

Inoneinterpretation,thegameisactuallyplayedmanytimesrepeatedly, andtheprobabilityofa purestrategyis thefractionofthe time itis playedinthe empirical limit (its so-called empirical frequency). In the other interpretation, not only is frequency thegameplayedrepeatedly,buteachtimeitinvolvestwodifferentagentsselected at random from a large population. In this interpretation, each agent in the population plays a pure strategy, and the probability ofa pure strategyrepresentsthe fractionofagentsplayingthatstrategy. Wereturntotheselearninginterpretations inChapter7. 3.3.4 Nash’stheorem: provingtheexistenceofNashequilibria We have now seen two examples in which we managed to find Nash equilibria (three equilibria for Battle of the Sexes, one equilibrium for Matching Pennies).
