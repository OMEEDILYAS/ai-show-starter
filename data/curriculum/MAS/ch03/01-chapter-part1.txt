3 Introduction to Noncooperative Game Theory: Games in Normal Form Game theory is the mathematical study of interaction among independent, selfinterestedagents.Ithasbeenappliedtodisciplinesasdiverseaseconomics(historically,itsmainareaofapplication),politicalscience,biology,psychology,linguistics— andcomputerscience.

We will return to that later in Chapter 12, but for now let us proceed withtheindividualisticapproach. 3.1 Self-interested agents What does it mean to say that agents are self-interested? It does not necessarily meanthattheywanttocauseharmtoeachother,oreventhattheycareonlyabout themselves. Instead, it means that each agent has his own description of which states of the world he likes—which can include good things happening to other agents—andthatheactsinanattemptto bringaboutthesestatesoftheworld. In thissectionwewillconsiderhowtomodelsuchinterests. utilitytheory The dominant approach to modeling an agent’s interests is utility theory. This theoreticalapproachaims to quantifyanagent’sdegreeofpreferenceacrossa set ofavailablealternatives.Thetheoryalsoaimstounderstandhowthesepreferences change when an agent faces uncertainty about which alternative he will receive. utilityfunction When we refer to an agent’s utility function, as we will do throughout much of this book, we will be making an implicit assumption that the agent has desires 48 3 IntroductiontoNoncooperativeGameTheory:GamesinNormalForm abouthowtoactthatareconsistentwithutility-theoreticassumptions.Thus,before we discuss game theory (and thus interactions between multiple utility-theoretic agents), we should examine some key properties of utility functions and explain whytheyarebelievedtoformasolidbasisforatheoryofpreferenceandrational action. Autilityfunctionisamappingfromstatesoftheworldtorealnumbers. These numbersare interpretedas measures ofan agent’s levelof happinessin the given states. When the agent is uncertain about which state of the world he faces, his utility is defined as the expected value of his utility function with respect to the appropriateprobabilitydistributionoverstates. 3.1.1 Example: friendsandenemies Webeginwithasimpleexampleofhowutilityfunctionscanbeusedasabasisfor making decisions. Consider an agent Alice, who has three options: going to the club(c), goingto a movie(m), orwatchinga videoat home(h). Ifshe is onher own,Alicehasautilityof100forc,50form,and50forh. However,Aliceisalso interestedin the activities oftwo otheragents, BobandCarol, whofrequentboth theclubandthemovietheater. BobisAlice’snemesis;heisdownrightpainfulto bearound.IfAlicerunsintoBobatthemovies,shecantrytoignorehimandonly suffers a disutility of 40; however, if she sees him at the club he will pester her endlessly, yielding hera disutility of 90. Unfortunately, Bob prefers the club: he isthere60%ofthetime, spendingtherestofhistimeatthemovietheater. Carol, ontheotherhand,isAlice’sfriend. Shemakeseverythingmorefun. Specifically, CarolincreasesAlice’sutilityforeitheractivitybyafactorof1.5(aftertakinginto accountthepossibledisutilityofrunningintoBob). Carolcanbefoundattheclub 25%ofthetime,andthemovietheater75%ofthetime. ItwillbeeasiertodetermineAlice’sbestcourseofactionifwelistAlice’sutility for each possible state of the world. There are 12 outcomes that can occur: Bob andCarolcaneachbein eitherthecluborthe movietheater,andAlicecanbein the club, the movie theater, or at home. Alice has a baseline level of utility for eachofherthreeactions,andthisbaselineisadjustedifeitherBob,Carol,orboth are present. Following the description of our example, we see that Alice’s utility is always 50 when she stays home, and for her other two activities it is given by Figure3.1. SohowshouldAlicechooseamongherthreeactivities? Toanswerthisquestion we need to combine her utility function with her knowledge of Bob and Carol’s randomizedentertainmenthabits.
