Brouwer’s Theorem3.3.17(Brouwer’sfixed-pointtheorem) Let f : be conm m △ 7→ △ fixed-point tinuous. Then f has a fixed point—that is, there exists some z such that m theorem f(z)= z. ∈ △ Proof.

Part 1: is a proper labeling. Let ǫ > 0. We simplicially subdivide3 m L △ such that the Euclidean distance between any two points in the same msubsimplexisatmostǫ.

In i i otherwords, (v)canbeanylabelisuchthatv > 0andf weaklydecreases i L the ith componentof v. To ensure that is well defined, we must show that L theintersectiononthe rightsideofEquation(3.1)is alwaysnonempty. (Intuitively, since v and f(v) are both on the standard simplex , and on m m △ △ each point’s components sum to 1, there must exist a componentof v that is weakly decreased by f. This intuition holds even though we restrict to the componentsin χ(v) becausethese are exactly all the positive componentsof v.) Wenowshowthisformally. Forcontradiction,assumeotherwise.
