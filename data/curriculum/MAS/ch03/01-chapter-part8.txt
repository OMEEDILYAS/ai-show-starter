pure strategy is a special case of a mixed strategy, in which the support is a single action. At the other end of the spectrum we have fully mixed fullymixed strategies. A strategy is fully mixed if it has full support (i.e., if it assigns every strategy actionanonzeroprobability). Wehavenotyetdefinedthepayoffsofplayersgivenaparticularstrategyprofile, since the payoff matrix defines those directly only for the special case of purestrategyprofiles. Butthegeneralizationtomixedstrategiesisstraightforward,and expectedutility reliesonthebasicnotionofdecisiontheory—expectedutility. Intuitively,wefirst calculatethe probabilityof reachingeach outcomegiventhe strategy profile, and then we calculate the average of the payoffs of the outcomes, weighted by the probabilitiesofeachoutcome. Formally,wedefinetheexpectedutilityasfollows (overloadingnotation,weuseu forbothutilityandexpectedutility). i Definition3.2.7(Expectedutilityofamixedstrategy) Givenanormal-formgame (N,A,u), the expected utility u for player i of the mixed-strategy profile s = i (s ,...,s )isdefinedas 1 n n u (s) = u (a) s (a ). i i j j a∈A j=1 X Y 3.3 Analyzinggames: from optimality toequilibrium Nowthatwehavedefinedwhatgamesinnormalformareandwhatstrategiesare available to players in them, the question is how to reason about such games. In optimalstrategy single-agent decision theory the key notion is that of an optimal strategy, that is, a strategy that maximizes the agent’s expectedpayofffor a givenenvironmentin which the agent operates. The situation in the single-agent case can be fraught with uncertainty, since the environmentmight be stochastic, partially observable, andspringallkindsofsurprisesontheagent. However,thesituationisevenmore complexinamultiagentsetting. Inthiscasetheenvironmentincludes—or,inmany cases we discuss, consists entirely of—otheragents, all ofwhom are also hoping tomaximizetheirpayoffs.Thusthenotionofanoptimalstrategyforagivenagent isnotmeaningful;thebeststrategydependsonthechoicesofothers.

Forexample,itmightbetemptingto saythatweshouldpreferoutcomesinwhichthesumofagents’utilities is higher. However,recall from Section 3.1.2thatwe canapply anypositiveaffine transformationtoan agent’sutility functionandobtainanothervalidutility function. For example,wecouldmultiplyallofplayer1’spayoffsby1,000,whichcouldclearly changewhichoutcomemaximizedthesumofagents’utilities. Thus, our problem is to find a way of saying that some outcomes are better than others, even when we only know agents’ utility functions up to a positive affinetransformation. Imaginethateachagent’sutilityisamonetarypaymentthat youwillreceive,butthateachpaymentcomesinadifferentcurrency,andyoudo notknowanythingabouttheexchangerates. Whichoutcomesshouldyouprefer? Observethat,whileitisnotusuallypossibletoidentifythebestoutcome,thereare situations in which you can be sure that one outcome is better than another. For example,it is betterto get10 unitsofcurrencyAand3units ofcurrencyB than toget9unitsofcurrencyAand3unitsofcurrencyB,regardlessoftheexchange rate. Weformalizethisintuitioninthefollowingdefinition. Pareto Definition3.3.1(Paretodomination) Strategy profile s Pareto dominates stratdomination egy profile s′ if for all i N, u (s) u (s′), and there exists some j N i i ∈ ≥ ∈ forwhichu (s) > u (s′). j j Inotherwords,inaPareto-dominatedstrategyprofilesomeplayercanbemade betteroffwithoutmakinganyotherplayerworseoff.
