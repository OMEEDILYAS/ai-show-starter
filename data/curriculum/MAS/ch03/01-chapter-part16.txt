Itdemonstratesthatmaxminstrategies, minmax strategies and Nash equilibria coincide in two-player, zero-sum games. In particular, Theorem 3.4.4 allows us to conclude that in two-player, zero-sum games: 1. Eachplayer’smaxminvalueis equalto his minmaxvalue. Byconvention,the valueofa maxminvalueforplayer1iscalledthevalueofthegame; zero-sumgame 2. Forbothplayers,thesetofmaxminstrategiescoincideswiththesetofminmax strategies;and 5.

Any maxmin strategy profile (or, equivalently, minmax strategy profile) is a Nashequilibrium. Furthermore,thesearealltheNashequilibria. Consequently, allNashequilibriahavethesamepayoffvector(namely,thoseinwhichplayer 1getsthevalueofthegame). Forexample,intheMatchingPenniesgameinFigure3.6,thevalueofthegame is 0. The uniqueNash equilibriumconsists ofboth playersrandomizingbetween headsandtails with equalprobability, whichis boththe maxminstrategyandthe minmaxstrategyforeachplayer. Nash equilibria in zero-sum games can be viewed graphically as a “saddle” in a high-dimensional space. At a saddle point, any deviation of the agent lowers hisutility andincreasestheutility oftheotheragent. Itis easytovisualizeinthe simplecasein whicheachagenthastwo purestrategies.

However, considera setting in which the other agentis not believedto be malicious, but is UncorrectedmanuscriptofMultiagentSystems,publishedbyCambridgeUniversityPress Revision1.1©Shoham&Leyton-Brown,2009,2010. 3.4 Furthersolutionconceptsfornormal-formgames 77 instead entirely unpredictable. (Crucially, in this section we do not approachthe problemasBayesians,sayingthatagenti’sbeliefscanbedescribedbyaprobabilitydistribution;instead,weusea“pre-Bayesian”modelinwhichidoesnotknow such a distribution and indeed has no beliefs about it.) In such a setting, it can makesenseforagentstocareaboutminimizingtheirworst-caselosses,ratherthan maximizingtheirworst-casepayoffs.

For this example it does not matter what agent2’s payoffs a,b,c, and d are, and we can evenimaginethat agent1 doesnotknow these values. Indeed, this could be one reason why player 1 would be unable to form beliefs about how player 2 would play, evenif he were to believe that player 2 was rational. Let us imagine that agent 1 wants to determine a strategy to follow that makes sense despite his uncertaintyaboutplayer2. First,agent1mightplayhismaxmin,or“safetylevel” strategy. Inthisgameitiseasytoseethatplayer1’smaxminstrategyistoplayB; thisisbecauseplayer2’sminmaxstrategyistoplayR,andB isabestresponseto R.
