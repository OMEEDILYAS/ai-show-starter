Dilemma game givenin Figure 3.3, the strategy C is not rationalizablefortherowplayer,becauseC is nota bestresponsetoanystrategythat thecolumnplayercouldplay. Similarly, considerthegamefromFigure3.15. M isnotarationalizablestrategyfortherowplayer: althoughitisabestresponseto a strategy of the column player’s (R), there do not exist any beliefs that the columnplayercouldholdabouttherowplayer’sstrategytowhichRwouldbeabest response. Becauseoftheinfiniteregress,theformaldefinitionofrationalizabilityissomewhat involved; however, it turns out that there are some intuitive things that we can say about rationalizable strategies. First, Nash equilibrium strategies are alwaysrationalizable: thus,thesetofrationalizablestrategies(andstrategyprofiles) isalwaysnonempty. Second,intwo-playergamesrationalizablestrategieshavea simplecharacterization: theyare thosestrategiesthatsurvivethe iteratedelimination of strictly dominatedstrategies. In n-playergames there exist strategies that surviveiteratedremovalofdominatedstrategiesbutarenotrationalizable. Inthis more general case, rationalizable strategies are those strategies that survive iterative removalof strategies thatare nevera bestresponseto any strategyprofile by theotherplayers. We now define rationalizability more formally. First we will define an infinite sequenceof(possiblymixed)strategiesS0,S1,S2,...foreachplayeri. LetS0 = i i i i S ;thus,foreachagenti,thefirstelementinthesequenceisthesetofalli’smixed i strategies. LetCH(S)denotetheconvexhullofasetS: thesmallestconvexset containing all the elements of S. Now we define Sk as the set of all strategies i s Sk−1 forwhich there exists somes CH(Sk−1) such thatfor all i ∈ i −i ∈ j6=i j s′ Sk−1, u (s ,s ) u (s′,s ). That is, a strategy belongs to Sk if there i ∈ i i i −i ≥ i i −i Q i is some strategy s for the other players in response to which s is at least as −i i goodasanyotherstrategyfromSk−1.

Some people feel that this is the most fundamental solution concept of all.7 In a standard game, each player mixes his pure strategies independently. For example, consider again the Battle of the Sexes game (reproduced here as Figure3.18)anditsmixed-strategyequilibrium. LW WL LW 2,1 0,0 WL 0,0 1,2 Figure3.18: BattleoftheSexesgame. As we saw in Section 3.3.3, this game’s unique mixed-strategy equilibrium yieldseachplayeranexpectedpayoffof2/3. Butnowimaginethatthetwoplayerscanobservetheresultofafaircoinflipandcanconditiontheirstrategiesbased on that outcome. They can now adopt strategies from a richer set; for example, they could choose “WL if heads, LW if tails.” Indeed, this pair forms an equilibriuminthisricherstrategyspace;giventhatoneplayerplaysthestrategy,theother player only loses by adopting another. Furthermore, the expected payoff to each playerinthisso-calledcorrelatedequilibriumis.5 2+.5 1 = 1.5. Thusboth ∗ ∗ agentsreceivehigherutility thantheydo underthe mixed-strategyequilibriumin theuncorrelatedcase(whichhadexpectedpayoffof2/3forbothagents),andthe outcome is fairer than either of the pure-strategy equilibria in the sense that the worst-offplayerachieveshigherexpectedutility. Correlating devicescan thus be quiteuseful. Theaforementionedexamplehadbothplayersobservetheexactoutcomeofthe coin flip, but the general setting does not require this. Generally, the setting includessomerandomvariable(the“externalevent”)withacommonly-knownprobabilitydistribution,andaprivatesignaltoeachplayerabouttheinstantiationofthe random variable. A player’s signal can be correlated with the random variable’s valueandwiththesignalsreceivedbyotherplayers,withoutuniquelyidentifying any of them. Standard games can be viewed as the degenerate case in which the signalsofthedifferentagentsareprobabilisticallyindependent. To model this formally, consider n random variables, with a joint distribution overthesevariables.Imaginethatnaturechoosesaccordingtothisdistribution,but 7.
