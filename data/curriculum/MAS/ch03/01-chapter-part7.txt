If commonpayoffgamesrepresentsituationsofpurecoordination,zero-sumgamesrepresent situationsofpurecompetition;oneplayer’sgainmustcomeatthe expenseofthe other player. This property requires that there be exactly two agents. Indeed, if you allow more agents, any game can be turned into a zero-sumgame by adding adummyplayerwhoseactionsdonotimpactthepayoffstotheotheragents,and whoseownpayoffsarechosentomakethepayoffsineachoutcomesumtozero.

Such astrategyiscalledamixedstrategy. Althoughitmaynotbeimmediatelyobvious why a player should introduce randomness into his choice of action, in fact in a multiagent setting the role of mixed strategies is critical.
