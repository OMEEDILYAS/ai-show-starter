Indeed,exceptintheextremecase in which there is a unique best response that is a pure strategy, the number of bestresponsesisalwaysinfinite. Whenthesupportofabestresponses∗ includes two or more actions, the agent must be indifferent among them—otherwise, the agentwouldpreferto reducetheprobabilityofplayingatleastoneofthe actions to zero. But thus any mixture of these actions must also be a best response, not only the particular mixture in s∗. Similarly, if there are two pure strategies that are individually best responses, any mixture of the two is necessarily also a best response. Of course, in general an agent will not know what strategies the other players plantoadopt. Thus,thenotionofbestresponseisnotasolutionconcept—itdoes notidentify an interesting set ofoutcomesin this generalcase.

However,wewillshowherethatthiscomputationalproblemiseasywhenweknow(orcanguess)thesupportoftheequilibrium strategies, particularly so in this small game. Let us now guess that both players randomize, and let us assume that husband’s strategy is to play LW with probability p and WL with probability 1 p. Then if the wife, the row player, also − mixes between her two actions, she must be indifferent between them, given the husband’sstrategy. (Otherwise,shewouldbebetteroffswitchingtoapurestrategy accordingto which sheonly playedthe betterofheractions.) Thenwe can write thefollowingequations. U (LW) =U (WL) wife wife 2 p+0 (1 p) =0 p+1 (1 p) ∗ ∗ − ∗ ∗ − 1 p = 3 We get the result that in order to make the wife indifferent between her actions, the husbandmustchooseLW with probability1/3 andWL with probability2/3.

By a similar calculation it can be shown that to make the husbandindifferent,thewife mustchooseLWwithprobability2/3 andWLwith probability 1/3. Now we can confirm that we have indeed foundan equilibrium: since both players play in a way that makes the other indifferent, they are both best
