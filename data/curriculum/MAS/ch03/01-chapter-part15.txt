This is because i will not usually be able toguaranteethatj achievesminimalpayoffbyactingunilaterally. However,ifwe assumethatalltheplayersotherthanjchooseto“gangup”onj—andthattheyare able to coordinateappropriatelywhenthere is more than onestrategy profile that wouldyieldthesameminimalpayoffforj—thenwecandefineminmaxstrategies forthen-playercase. minmaxstrategy Definition3.4.3(Minmax,n-player) In an n-player game, the minmax strategy forplayeriagainstplayerj = iisi’scomponentofthemixed-strategyprofiles −j 6 intheexpressionargmin max u (s ,s ),where jdenotesthesetofplays−j sj j j −j − ersotherthanj.

Proof. At least one Nash equilibrium must exist by Theorem 3.3.22. Let (s′,s′ ) be an arbitrary Nash equilibrium, and denote i’s equilibrium payoff i −i asv . Denotei’smaxminvalueasv¯ andi’sminmaxvalueasv . i i i First, show that v¯ = v . Clearly we cannot have v¯ > v , as if this were i i i i truetheniwouldprofitbydeviatingfroms′ tohismaxminstrategy,andhence i (s′,s′ ) would not be a Nash equilibrium. Thus it remains
