Intuitively, all strictly dominatedpure strategies can be ignored,since they can neverbe bestresponsesto any movesby the otherplayers. There are severalsubtleties, however. First, once a pure strategy is eliminated, anotherstrategy that was not dominated canbecomedominated. Andsothisprocessofeliminationcanbecontinued. Second,apurestrategymaybedominatedbyamixtureofotherpurestrategieswithout beingdominatedbyanyofthemindependently. Toseethis, considerthegamein Figure3.15. ColumnR can beeliminated, since it is dominatedby, for example,columnL. WeareleftwiththereducedgameinFigure3.16. In this game M is dominated by neither U nor D, but it is dominated by the mixedstrategy thatselects either U orD with equalprobability.

In the previous example, ratherthancomputingtheNashequilibriaoftheoriginal3 3game,wecannow × compute them for this 2 2 game, applying the technique described earlier. In × some cases, the procedure ends with a single cell; this is the case, for example, with the Prisoner’s Dilemma game. In this case we say that the game is solvable byiteratedelimination. Clearly, in any finite game, iterated elimination ends after a finite number of iterations. Onemightworrythat,ingeneral,theorderofeliminationmightaffect thefinaloutcome.

However,theeliminationordercanmakeadifferencetothefinalreducedgameif weremoveweaklyorveryweaklydominatedstrategies. Which flavor of domination should we concern ourselves with? In fact, each flavorhasadvantagesanddisadvantages,whichiswhywepresentallofthemhere. Strict dominationleadsto better-behavediterated elimination: it yields a reduced gamethatisindependentoftheeliminationorder,anditeratedeliminationismore computationallymanageable.(Thisandothercomputationalissuesregardingdomination are discussed in Section 4.5.3.) There is also a further related advantage that we will defer to Section 3.4.4. Weak domination can yield smaller reduced games, but under iterated elimination the reduced game can depend on the elimination order. Very weak domination can yield even smaller reduced games, but againthesereducedgamesdependonelimination order. Furthermore, veryweak domination does not impose a strict order on strategies: when two strategies are equivalent,eachveryweaklydominatestheother. Forthisreason,thislastformof dominationisgenerallyconsideredtheleastimportant. 3.4.4 Rationalizability rationalizable A strategy is rationalizable if a perfectly rational player could justifiably play it strategy against one or more perfectly rational opponents. Informally, a strategy profile for player i is rationalizable if it is a best response to some beliefs that i could have about the strategies that the other players will take. The wrinkle, however, isthaticannothavearbitrarybeliefsabouttheotherplayers’actions—hisbeliefs musttakeintoaccounthisknowledgeoftheirrationality,whichincorporatestheir knowledgeofhisrationality,theirknowledgeofhisknowledgeoftheirrationality, andsooninaninfiniteregress.
