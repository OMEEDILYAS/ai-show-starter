A further improvementis to store only Nogoodsthat are consistentwith boththe agent’s agent_view and his current assignment. This approach, which is considered by some the best implementation of the ABT algorithm, ensures that the number of Nogoods stored by any single agent is no larger than the size of the domain.

The ABT algorithm was initially introduced in Yokoo [1994]. More comprehensive treatments, including the latest insights into distributed CSPs, appear in Meisels [2008] and Faltings [2006].
