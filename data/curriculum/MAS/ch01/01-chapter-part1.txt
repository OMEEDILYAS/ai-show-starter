1 Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Inthischapterandthenextwediscusscooperativesituationsinwhichagentscollaborate to achieve a common goal. This goal can be viewed as shared between the agents or, alternatively, as the goalof a centraldesignerwho is designingthe various agents. Of course, if such a designer exists, a natural question is why it matters that there are multiple agents; they can be viewed merely as end sensors andeffectorsforexecutingtheplandevisedbythedesigner. However,thereexist situations in which a problem needs to be solved in a distributed fashion, either because a central controller is not feasible or because one wants to make good sensornetwork useofthedistributed resources. A goodexampleis providedbysensornetworks. Suchnetworksconsistofmultipleprocessingunits,eachwithlocalsensorcapabilities,limitedprocessingpower,limitedpowersupply,andlimitedcommunication bandwidth. Despite these limitations, thesenetworks aim to providesome global service. Figure 1.1 shows an example of a fielded sensor network used for monitoring environmentalquantities like humidity, temperatureand pressure in an office environment. Each sensor can monitor only its local area and, similarly, can communicateonlywithothersensorsinitslocalvicinity. Thequestioniswhatalgorithmtheindividualsensorsshouldrunsothatthecentercanstillpiecetogether areliableglobalpicture. Distributed algorithms have beenwidely studied in computerscience. We concentrate on distributed problem-solvingalgorithms ofthe sort studied in artificial intelligence. We divide the discussion into two parts. In this chapter we cover distributedconstraintsatisfaction,whereagentsattemptinadistributedfashionto find a feasible solution to a problem with global constraints.
