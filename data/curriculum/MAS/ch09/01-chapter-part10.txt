Such an assumption is inconsistent with even our weak transitivity definitions. However, we can broaden the scope of IIA to allow for transitive effects, and thereby still express the idea that the ranking rule should rank pairs of outcomes based only on local information.

First, what happens if we simply drop the weak transitivity requirementaltogether? Let us add the requirements thatan agent’s rank canimproveonly when he receivesmore votes (“positive response”)andthat the agents’identities are ignoredby the rankingfunction (“anonymity”). Thenitcanbeshownthatapprovalvoting,whichwehavealready consideredinthissetting,istheonlypossiblerankingfunction.
