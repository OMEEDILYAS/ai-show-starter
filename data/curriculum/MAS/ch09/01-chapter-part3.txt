Consider the following preferences,whichwediscussedpreviously. 35agents: a c b ≻ ≻ 33agents: b a c ≻ ≻ 32agents: c b a ≻ ≻ First, considerthe ordera,b,c. ais eliminatedin the pairingbetweena andb; thencischoseninthepairingbetweenbandc.

Thus, giventhesepreferences,the agendasettercanselect whicheveroutcome hewantsbyselectingtheappropriateeliminationorder! Next,considerthefollowingpreferences. 1agent: b d c a ≻ ≻ ≻ 1agent: a b d c ≻ ≻ ≻ 1agent: c a b d ≻ ≻ ≻ Consider the elimination ordering a,b,c,d. In the pairing between a and b, a is preferred;c is preferredto a andthend is preferredto c, leavingdas the winner. However, all of the agents prefer b to d—the selected candidate is Pareto dominated! Last, we give an example showing that Borda is fundamentally different from pairwiseelimination, regardlessofthe eliminationordering. Considerthefollowingpreferences. 3agents:
