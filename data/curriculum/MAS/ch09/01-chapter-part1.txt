In this chapterthis will take us away from gametheory, butbefore toolong(inthenexttwochapters)itwillbringusrightbacktoit. 9.1 Introduction A simple example of the designer perspective is voting. How should a central authority pool the preferences of different agents so as to best reflect the wishes of the population as a whole? It turns out that voting, the kind familiar from our politicalandotherinstitutions,isonlyaspecialcaseofthegeneralclassofsocial socialchoice choiceproblems. Social choice is a motivationalbut nonstrategictheory—agents problem have preferences, but do not try to camouflage them in order to manipulate the outcome (of voting, for example) to their personal advantage.1 This problem is thus analogous to the problem of belief fusion that we present in Section 14.2.1, whichisalsononstrategic;here,however,weexaminetheproblemofaggregating preferencesratherthanbeliefs. Westartwithabriefandinformaldiscussionofthemostfamiliarvotingscheme, plurality. We then give the formal model of social choice theory, consider other voting schemes, and present two seminal results aboutthe sorts of preferenceaggregationrulesthatitispossibletoconstruct.

Each kid has a different preference over these activities, which is represented as a strict total ordering over the activities and which he reveals to you truthfully. By a b denote the proposition that outcome a is ≻ preferredtooutcomeb. Will: a b c ≻ ≻ Liam: b c a ≻ ≻ Vic: c b a ≻ ≻ Whatshouldyoudo?
