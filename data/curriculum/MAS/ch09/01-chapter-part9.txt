Specifically, considera setting in which the set of agents is the same as the set of outcomes— agents are asked to vote to expresstheir opinionsabouteach other, with the goal ofdeterminingasocialranking. Suchsettingshavegreatpracticalimportance. For example,searchenginesrankWebpagesbyconsideringhyperlinksfromonepage to another to be votes about the importance of the destination pages. Similarly, online auction sites employ reputation systems to provide assessments of agents’ trustworthinessbasedonratingsfrompasttransactions.

(Recall that the proofof Theorem 9.4.4 requires arbitrarypreferencesand O 3.) | |≥ AlthoughthepossibilityofcircumventingArrow’stheoremis encouraging,the discussion does not end here. Due to the special nature of the ranking systems setting,thereareotherpropertiesthatwewouldlikearankingruletosatisfy. First,consideranexampleinwhichAlicevotesonlyforBob,Willvotesonlyfor Liam,andLiamvotesonlyforVic. ThesevotesareillustratedinFigure9.2. Who shouldbe rankedhighest? Three ofthe fivekids havereceivedvotes (Bob, Liam, andVic); thesethreeshouldpresumablyrankhigherthantheremainingtwo. But ofthethree,Vicisspecial: heistheonlyonewhosevoter(Liam)himselfreceived a vote. Thus, intuitively, Vic should receive the highest rank. This intuition is capturedbytheideaoftransitivity. First we define strong transitivity. We will subsequently relax this definition; however,itisusefulforwhatfollows.

One way in which this definition is quitestrongis thatitdoesnottakeintoaccountthenumber ofvotesthatavoting agent places. Consider an example in which Vic votes for almost all the kids, whereasRayvotesonlyforone. IfVicandRayarerankedthesamebytheranking rule, strongtransitivity requiresthattheirvotesmustcountequally.
