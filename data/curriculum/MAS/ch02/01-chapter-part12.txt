finite numberof bids on bundles that include a particulartime slot, it mustbe the casethat the price onthis slotis so highthat every agent prefers the empty bundle to all bundles that include this slot. Eventually, this condition will hold for all time slots, and thus no agent will bid on a nonempty bundle, contradicting the assumption that the algorithm does not converge. In the worst case, in each iteration only one of the n agentsbids, and this bidisonasingleslot.

Whilehecannotredesigncarsorcreatenewroads,hecanimpose sociallaw traffic rules. A traffic rule is a form of a social law: a restriction on the given strategiesoftheagents.

Foragivenagent,asociallawpresentsa tradeoff;hesuffersfromlossoffreedom,butcanbenefitfromthefactthatothers losesomefreedom. Agoodsociallawisdesignedtobenefitallagents. One natural formal view of social laws is from the perspectiveof game theory. WediscussgametheoryindetailstartinginChapter3,buthereweneedverylittle ofthatmaterial. Forourpurposeshere,sufficeittosaythatinagameeachagent has a number of possible strategies (in our traffic example, driving plans), and depending on the strategies selected by each agent, each agent receives a certain payoff. In general,agentsare freeto choosetheirownstrategies, whichtheywill do based on their guesses about the strategies of other agents. Sometimes the interestsoftheagentsareatoddswith eachother,butsometimestheyarenot. In theextremecasetheinterestsareperfectlyaligned,andtheonlyproblemisthatof coordinationamongtheagents. Again,trafficpresentstheperfectexample;agents are equally happy driving on the left or on the right, provided everyonedoes the same. Asociallawsimplyeliminatesfromagivengamecertainstrategiesforeachof the agents, and thus induces a subgame. When the subgame consists of a single social strategy for each agent, we call it a social convention. In many cases the setting convention isnaturallysymmetric(thegameissymmetric,asaretherestrictions),butitneed notbethatway. Asociallawisgoodiftheinducedsubgameis“preferred"tothe original one. There can be different notions of preference here; we will discuss thisfurtherafterwediscussthenotionofsolutionconceptsinChapter3. Fornow we leave the notion of preferenceat the intuitive level; intuitively, a world where everyone (say) drives on the right and stops at red lights is preferable to one in whichdriverscannotrely on suchlaws andmust constantlycoordinatewith each other. This leaves the question of how one might find such a good social law or socialconvention. InChapter7 we adopta democraticperspective;welookathow conventions can emerge dynamically as a result of a learning process within the population. Here we adopt a more autocratic perspective, and imagine a social plannerimposingagoodsociallaw(orevenasingleconvention). Thequestionis howsucha benigndictatorarrivesatsucha goodsociallaw. In generalthe problem is hard;specifically, whenformally defined,thegeneralproblemoffindinga good social law (underan appropriate notion of “good”)can be shown to be NPhard. However, the news is not all bad. First, there exist restrictions that render theproblempolynomial. Furthermore,inspecificsituations,onecansimplyhand craftgoodsociallaws. Indeed, traffic rules provide an excellent example.
