individualagents “bid” forthe different resources in a prespecified way. We will look at open outcry, ascending auction-like procedures, resembling the English auction discussed in Chapter 11. Before that, however, we take a slightly closer look at the connection between optimizationproblemsandcompetitiveequilibrium. Competitiveequilibriumandprimal-dualproblems Theorem2.3.5mayseem atfirst almostmagical; whywouldan economicnotion prove relevant to an optimization problem? However, a slightly closer look removessomeofthemystery. RatherthanlookingatthespecificLPcorresponding totheassignmentproblem,considerthegeneral(“primal”)formofanLP. n maximize c x i i i=1 X n subjectto a x b j 1,...,m ij i j ≤ ∀ ∈ { } i=1 X x 0 i 1,...,n i ≥ ∀ ∈ { } Notethatthisformulationmakesreverseusethe and signsascomparedto ≤ ≥ theformulationinAppendixB.

Imagine a production economy, in which you have a set of resources and economy asetofproducts. Each productconsumesacertain amountofeachresource,and each product is sold at a certain price. Interpret x as the amount of product i i produced, and c as the price of product i. Then the optimization problem can i be interpreted as profit maximization. Of course, this must be done within the constraints of available resources. If we interpret b as the available amount of j resourcejanda astheamountofresourcejneededtoproduceaunitofproducti, ij thentheconstraint a x b appropriatelycapturesthelimitationonresource i ij i ≤ j j. P Nowconsiderthedualproblem. m minimize b y i i i=1 X m subjectto a y c j 1,...,n ij i j ≥ ∀ ∈{ } i=1 X y 0 i 1,...,m i ≥ ∀ ∈ { } It turns out that y can also be given a meaningful economic interpretation, i shadowprice namely,asthemarginalvalueofresourcei, alsoknownasits shadowprice. The shadowprice capturesthe sensitivity ofthe optimal solutionto a smallchangein theavailabilityofthatparticularresource,holdingeverythingelseconstant.Ahigh shadow price means that increasing its availability would have a large impact on theoptimalsolution,andviceversa.3 Thishelpsexplainwhytheeconomicperspectiveonoptimization,atleastinthe contextoflinearprogramming,isnotthatodd.
