only robot who will arrive at a node—any node—is i t mod k. This is an example of a simple social ≡ convention that is useful, but that comes at a price. Each robot is free to travel along the shortest path, but will traverse this path k times more slowly than he wouldwithoutthisparticularsociallaw. Here is a more efficient convention. Assign each vertex an arbitrary label between 0 and k 1, and define the time to traverse an edge between vertices − labeled x and y to be (y x) mod k if (y x) mod k > 0, and k oth- − − erwise. Observe that the difference in this expression will sometimes be negative; this is not a problem because the modulo nevertheless returns a nonnegaFreeforon-screenuse;pleasedonotdistribute.Youcangetanotherfreecopy ofthisPDFororderthebookathttp://www.masfoundations.org. 46 2 DistributedOptimization tive value.
