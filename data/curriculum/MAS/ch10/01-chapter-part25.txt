saw how imposing social laws—that is, restricting the options available to agents—can be beneficial to all agents. Social laws played an important coordinating role (as in “driveon the rightside ofthe road")and, furthermore, in some Freeforon-screenuse;pleasedonotdistribute.Youcangetanotherfreecopy ofthisPDFororderthebookathttp://www.masfoundations.org. 322 10 ProtocolsforStrategicAgents:MechanismDesign casespreventedthenarrowselfinterestsofthe agentsfromhurtingthem(e.g., allowingcooperationinthePrisoners’Dilemmagame). However,inthatdiscussion wemadetheimportantassumptionthatonceasociallawwasimposed(oragreed upon,dependingontheinterpretation),theagentscouldbeassumedtofollowit. Here we relax this assumption,and we do so in three ways. First, we viewthe players as having the option of entering into a contractamong themselves. Once theydo—andonlythen—thecentercanimposearbitraryfinesonlawbreakers,if he is aware of such deviations. The question in this case is which contracts the agentscanbeexpectedtoenter,andhowtheworkofthecentercanbeminimized oreveneliminated. Second, we considerthe case in which the centercan simply bribetheplayerstoplayacertainway(or,inmoreneutrallanguage,offerpositive incentivesforcertainactions).

Whatoutcomes may the center suggest, with associated penalties, that the agents will accept?

Althoughthe centercan achievealmostany outcome, it would seem to require greateffort:suggestinganoutcome,collectingsignatures,observingthegame,and enforcing the contracts.
