in Section 10.4.5, efficient choice rules can require unreasonable amounts of computation, and hence bothGrovesmechanismsandAGVcanfailto satisfythe tractabilityproperty. In this sectionweconsidertwoways ofaddressingthis issue. Thefirst is to explore dominant-strategy mechanisms that implement different social choice functions. We havealreadyseenthatthe quasilinearpreferencesetting is considerablymore amenable to dominant strategy implementation than the unrestricted preferences setting. However,thereare still limits—whatare they? Second, we will examine an alternate way of building mechanisms, by using a Groves payment rule with an alternate choice function, and leveraging agents’ computational limitations in ordertoachievetheimplementation. 10.5.1 Whatelsecanbeimplementedindominantstrategies?
