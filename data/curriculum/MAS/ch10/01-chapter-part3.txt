that deserves mention is ex post implementation. Recall from Section 6.3.4that an ex post equilibrium has the property that no agentcan evergainby changinghis strategy evenif he observesthe otheragents’types, as longasalltheotheragentsfollowtheequilibriumstrategies.Thus,unlikeaBayes– Nashequilibrium,anexpostequilibriumdoesnotdependonthetypedistribution. Regardless of the implementation concept, we can require that the desired social choicefunctionisimplementedintheonlyequilibrium,ineveryequilibriumorin atleastoneequilibriumoftheunderlyinggame. 10.2.2 Therevelation principle truthfulness Onepropertythatisoftendesiredofmechanismsiscalledtruthfulness. Thisproperty holds when agents truthfully disclose their preferences to the mechanism in equilibrium. It turns out that this property can always be achieved regardless of the socialchoice functionimplementedand ofthe agents’preferences.

Since in a Bayesiangameanagent’sprivate information is his type, direct mechanisms have A = Θ .

We can thus speak about incentive compatibility in dominantstrategies i i compatibilityin and Bayes–Nash incentive compatibility. Our claim that truthfulness can always dominant be achievedimplies, for example, that the social choice functions implementable strategies by dominant-strategy truthful mechanisms are precisely those implementable by strategy-proofdirectmechanisms.

In other words, any solution to a mechanism design problem can be converted intooneinwhichagentsalwaysrevealtheirtruepreferences,ifthenewmechanism “lies for the agents” in just the way they would have chosen to lie to the original mechanism. The revelation principle is arguably the most basic result in mechanismdesign. Itmeansthat,whileonemighthavethoughtapriorithataparticular mechanismdesignproblemcalls foranarbitrarilycomplexstrategyspace,infact onecanrestrictone’sattentiontotruthful,directmechanisms. As we asserted earlier, the revelation principle does not apply only to implementation in dominantstrategies; we have stated the theorem in this way only to keep things simple. Following exactly the same argument we can argue that, for example,amechanismthatimplementsa socialchoicefunctionin aBayes–Nash equilibriumcanbeconvertedintoadirect,Bayes–Nashincentivecompatiblemechanism.
