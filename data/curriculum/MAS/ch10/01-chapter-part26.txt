It has just implemented, in dominant strategies, a desired behavior (which had previously been obtained in one of the game’s Nash equilibria) at zero cost, relying only on its creditability, withoutmodifyingthe rules ofinteractions orenforcinganytype of behavior!

Specific publications that underlie some of the results covered in thischapterareasfollows. Thefoundationalideaofmechanismsascommunicationsystemsthatselectoutcomesbasedon messagesfrom agentsis due to Hurwicz [1960], who also elaboratedthetheorytoincludetheideathatmechanismsshouldbe“incentivecompatible”[1972]. Therevelationprinciplewas firstarticulatedbyGibbard[1973]and wasdevelopedinthegreatestgeneralitybyMyerson[1979;1982;1986]. In2007, Hurwiczand Myersonshareda NobelPrize (alongwith Maskin, whose workwe donotdiscussinthisbook),“forhavinglaidthefoundationsofmechanismdesign theory.” Theorem10.2.6isduetobothSatterthwaiteandGibbard,intwoseparate publications[Gibbard,1973;Satterthwaite,1975]. The VCG mechanism was anticipated by Vickrey [1961], who outlined an extensionofthesecond-priceauctiontomultipleidenticalgoods. Groves[1973]explicitlyconsideredthegeneralfamilyoftruthfulmechanismsapplyingtomultiple distinctgoods(thoughthe resulthad appearedalreadyin his 1969Ph.D. dissertation). Clarke [1971]proposedhis tax for use with public goods (i.e., goods such as roads and national defense that are paid for by all regardless of personal use). Theorem 10.4.3 is due to Green and Laffont [1977]; Theorem 10.4.11 is due to that paper as well as to the earlier Hurwicz [1975]. The fact that Groves mechanismsarepayoffequivalenttoallotherBayes–Nashincentive-compatibleefficient mechanisms was shown by Krishna and Perry [1998] and Williams [1999]; the former reference also gave the results that VCG is ex interim individually rational and that VCG collects the maximal amount of revenue among all ex interim individually-rational Groves mechanisms. Recent work shows that some “VCG drawbacks”arealsoproblemswithbroadclassesofmechanisms;forexample,this hasbeenshownfornonfrugality[ArcherandTardos,2002;Elkindetal.,2004]and forrevenuemonotonicity[Rastegarietal.,2007]. Theproblemofparticipatingin Grovesmechanismsundermultipleidentities(specificallyinthecaseofcombinatorial auctions, which are described in Section 11.3) was investigated by Yokoo [2006].
