As we indicated at the beginning of the section, work on algorithmic mechanism design often focuses on the use of approximation algorithms. Such an approachis sensibleforthe task schedulingproblembecausefinding the makespanminimizing allocation (x(tˆ) in compensationand penalty mechanisms)is an NPhardproblem,whereasapproximationalgorithmscanruninpolynomialtime. Althoughwedonotgointothedetailshere,thereis awholeconstellationofresults about what approximation bounds are achievable by which variety of dominantstrategyapproximation-algorithm-basedmechanism,underwhatassumptions(e.g., verification possible or not; restrictions on valuations). For example, in the case without verification no deterministic mechanism based on an approximation algorithm can achieve better than a 2-approximation; this bound is tight for the 2 agentcase.

However,optimizingtrafficinthiswayisdifficultbecausethe networkoperatordoesnotknowtheusers’tasksorhowimportanttheyare. Thus, the network operator faces a mechanism design problem. Although much more elaborate settings have been studied (see the notes at the end of the chapter), in thissectionwewillconsidertheproblemofallocatingthecapacityofasinglelink in a network. The reason that this problem is still tricky is that the bandwidthof Freeforon-screenuse;pleasedonotdistribute.Youcangetanotherfreecopy ofthisPDFororderthebookathttp://www.masfoundations.org. 310 10 ProtocolsforStrategicAgents:MechanismDesign alink isnotallocatedall-or-nothingto asinglebuyer,asitwas inourexampleat the beginning of the chapter (Section 10.1.2). Instead, the link has a real-valued capacitythatcanbedividedarbitrarilybetweentheagents. Thus,eventhissimple problem considers an choice space X that is uncountably infinite, and valuation functionsthatcanbeunderstoodascontinuous“demandcurves.” Formally,consideradomainwithN userswhowanttouseanetworkresource with capacity C R .

P i µ Unlike most of the mechanisms discussed in this chapter, the proportional allocation mechanism is not direct. However, this is one of its attractive qualities. Evenunderourassumptionsofconcavity,continuity,andmonotonicity,anagent’s valuationfunctioncan be arbitrarily complex. In a realnetwork system, it would defeatthe purposeof an allocation mechanism to allow agents to communicatea greatdealofinformationabouttheirvaluationfunctions—thewholeidea is to allocatebandwidthefficiently.
