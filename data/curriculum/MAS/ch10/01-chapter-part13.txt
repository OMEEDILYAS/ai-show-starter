the current interaction—for example, the agents may know that theywill competewith eachotheragainin the future. Insuchsettings, itis often preferable to elicit only as much information from agents as is required to determinethe socialwelfaremaximizingchoiceandcomputethe VCG payments. We discussthisissuefurtherwhenwecometoascendingauctionsinChapter11. 2. Susceptibilitytocollusion Consider a referendum setting in which three agents use the VCG mechanism to decide between two choices. For example, this mechanism could be useful in the road-building referendumsetting discussed earlier. Table 10.1 shows a set of valuationsandtheVCGpaymentsthateachagentwouldberequiredtomake. We knowfromTheorem10.4.2thatnoagentcangainbychanginghis declaration. However, the same cannotbe said about groups of agents. It turns out that groups of colluding agents can achieve higher utility by coordinating their declarations rather than honestly reporting their valuations. For example, Table 10.2 showsthatagents1and2canreducebothoftheirpaymentswithoutchangingthe mechanism’sdecisionbybothincreasingtheirdeclaredvaluationsby$50.

Consideragraphwherethereareonlytwopaths,eachownedbyasingle agent. In this case VCG selects the shortest path and pays the cost of the longer path,nomatterhowmuchlongeritis. It might seem more promising to hope that VCG’s payments would be at least close to the cost of the second shortest disjoint path. Indeed, in our two-agent examplethisisalwaysexactlywhatVCGpays. However,nowconsideradifferent graph that has two paths as illustrated in Figure 10.5. The top path involves k agents,eachofwhomhasacostof c;thus,thepathhasatotalcostofc. Thelower k path involves a single agentwith a cost of c(1+ǫ). VCG would select the path withcostc,andpayeachofthekagentsc(1+ǫ) (k 1)c. HenceVCG’stotal − − k paymentwouldbec(1+kǫ). Forfixedǫ,thismeansthatVCG’spaymentisΘ(k) times the cost of the second shortest disjoint path. Thus VCG is said not to be a frugalmechanism. 4.

(Thisassumptionmightbereasonable,forexample,ifthemechanismisexecuted over the Internet.) Note that this strategy is not without its risks, however: for example, if agent 1’s valuation were 150, both of agent 2’s identities would be pivotalandsoagent2wouldenduppayingmorethanhistruevaluation.
