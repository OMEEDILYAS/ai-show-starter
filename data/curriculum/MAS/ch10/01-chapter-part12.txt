Indeed,wecansaysomethingmoreaboutVCG’srevenueproperties:restricting ourselves to settings in which VCG is ex post individually rational as discussed earlier, and comparing to all other efficient and ex interim IR mechanisms, VCG turnsouttocollectthemaximalamountofrevenuefromtheagents. Thisissomewhat surprising, since this result does not require dominantstrategies, and hence compares VCG to all Bayes–Nash mechanisms. A useful corollary of this result is that VCG is as budget balancedas any efficient mechanism can be: it satisfies weak budget balance in every case where any dominant strategy, efficient and ex interimIRmechanismwouldbeabletodoso. 10.4.5 DrawbacksofVCG The VCG mechanism is one of the most powerful positive results in mechanism design: itgivesusageneralwayofconstructingdominant-strategytruthfulmechanisms to implement social-welfare-maximizing social choice functions in quasilinearsettings. Wehaveseenthatnofundamentallydifferentmechanismcoulddo the samejob. And VCG givesus evenmore: underthe rightconditionsitfurther guaranteesex post individualrationality andweakbudgetbalance. Thus, itis not surprising that this mechanism has been enormously influential and continues to bewidelystudied. However, despite these attractive properties, VCG also has some undesirable characteristics. In this section, we survey six of them. Before we go on, however,we offera caveat: althoughthere exist mechanismsthatcircumventeachof the drawbackswe discuss, none of the drawbacksare unique to VCG, or evento Grovesmechanisms. Indeed,insomecasestheproblemsareknowntocropupin extremely broad classes of mechanisms; we cite some arguments to this effect at theendofthechapter.
