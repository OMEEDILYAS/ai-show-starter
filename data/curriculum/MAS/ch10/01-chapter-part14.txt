This turns out to be surprisingly hard to achieve, even when the “no single-agenteffect” property holds, because the possibility of receivingarebateafterthemechanismhasbeenrunchangestheagents’incentives. In fact, even if profits are given to a charity that the agents care about, or spent in a way that benefits the local economyand hence benefits the agents, the VCG mechanism can be undermined.

Computationalintractability Finally, evenwhenthere areno problemsin principlewith usingVCG, there can stillbepracticalobstacles. Perhapsthebiggestsuchproblemisthatefficientmechanismscanrequireunreasonableamountsofcomputation:evaluatingtheargmax can require solving an NP-hard problem in many practical domains. Thus, VCG can fail to satisfy the tractability property (Definition 10.3.10). This problem is notjusttheoretical:wepresentimportantexamplesinwhichVCGisintractablein Sections 11.2.3and11.3.2.

TheAGVmechanismillustratestwosensesinwhichwecandiscovernew,useful mechanisms by relaxing properties that we had previously insisted on. First, our move from dominant-strategy incentive compatibility to Bayes–Nash incentive compatibility allowed us to circumvent Theorem 10.4.3, which told us that efficiencycanbeachievedunderdominantstrategiesonlybyGrovesmechanisms. (AGV is also efficient, butis nota Grovesmechanism.) Second, movingfrom ex interim to ex ante individualrationality is sufficientto getaroundthe negativeresult from Theorem 10.4.12, that we cannot simultaneously achieve weak budget balance, efficiency, and ex interim individualrationality, evenunderBayes–Nash equilibrium.
