Instead,letus assumethatagentsareprice takers: that they considerthe rate µ to be fixed and that they select the best declarations w given µ. (In fact, an agent’s declaration w is used in the calculation of µ; i i thus, we assume that agents disregard this connection.) Given this assumption, it is interesting to ask whether allocations chosen by our mechanism constitute a competitive competitive equilibrium (Definition 2.3.4). Formally, a declaration profile w and equilibrium rate µ constitute a competitive equilibrium if each w maximizes i’s quasilinear i 11.

It is possible to prove the following i µ − i C result. P Theorem10.6.3 Given n agents with valuation functions (v ,...,v ) and a re1 n sourcewith capacityC > 0, there exists a competitive equilibrium(w,µ) ofthe proportional allocation mechanism. Furthermore, the allocation is efficient: the choicesd = wi maximizethe socialwelfare v (d ) w subjectto capacity i µ i i i − i constraints. P Thus, given price-taking agents, full efficiency can be achieved by the proportionalallocationmechanism,eventhoughitonlyelicitsasinglescalarvaluefrom eachagent. Now,letusreturntothemorestandardgame-theoreticsetting,in whichagents take into account their abilities to affect µ through their own declarations. Thus, our solution conceptshifts from the competitive equilibrium to the Nash equilibrium. It is possible to show that a Nash equilibrium exists12 and that it is unique. HowdoesthisNashequilibriumcomparetothecompetitiveequilibriumdescribed inTheorem10.6.3? Thenaturalwaytoformalizethisquestionistoaskwhatfractionofthesocialwelfareachievedinthecompetitiveequilibriumisalsoachieved in the Nash equilibrium. When we ask how small this fraction becomes in the priceofanarchy worst case, we arrive precisely at the notion of minimizing the price of anarchy (seeDefinition10.3.14; recallalsoourprevioususeofthe priceofanarchyinthe contextof“selfishrouting”inSection6.4.5).

Sofar,wehaveanalyzedagivenmechanismratherthanshowingthatthismechanism optimizes some objective function. However, the proportional allocation mechanism can indeed be justified in this way.
