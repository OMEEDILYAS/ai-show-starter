Let us see an example of how the VCG mechanism works. Recall that Section10.1.2discussedtheproblemofbuyingashortestpathinatransportationnetwork. We will now reconsiderthat example, and determine what route and what paymentstheVCGmechanismwouldselect.

Note that in this example, the numbers labeling the edges in the graph denote agents’costsratherthanutilities;thus,anagent’sutilityis cifarouteinvolving his edge (having cost c) is selected, and zero otherwise. T − he argmax in x will amounttocostminimization. Thus,x(v)willreturntheshortestpathinthegraph, whichisABEF. How much will agents have to pay? First, let us consider the agent AC. The shortestpathtakinghisdeclarationintoaccounthasalengthof5andimposesacost of 5 on agents other than him (because it does not involve him). Likewise, the − shortestpath withoutAC’s declarationalso hasa length of5. Thus, his payment is p = ( 5) ( 5) = 0. This is what we expect, since AC is not pivotal. AC − − − Clearly, by the same argument BD, CE, CF, and DF will all be made to pay zero. Now let us consider the pivotal agents. The shortest path taking AB’s declaration into account has a length of 5, and imposes a cost of 2 on other agents. The shortest path without AB is ACEF, which has a cost of 6. Thus p = AB ( 6) ( 2) = 4: AB is paid 4 for his participation. Arguing similarly, you − − − − can verify that p = ( 6) ( 4) = 2, and p = ( 7) ( 4) = 3.

Wehavealsoseenthatnoothermechanismhasbothofthesepropertiesingeneral quasilinearsettings. Thus, we might be a bit worried that we have not been able to guarantee either individual rationality or budget balance, two properties that are quite important in practice. (Recall that individual rationality means that no agent would prefer not to participate in the mechanism; budget balance means that the mechanism does not lose money.) We will consider budget balance in Section10.4.6;hereweinvestigateindividualrationality. Asit turnsout,ourworryis wellfounded: evenwiththe freedomtoseth , we i cannotfindamechanismthatguaranteesusindividualrationalityinanunrestricted quasilinearsetting. However,we are often able to guaranteethe strongestvariety ofindividualrationalitywhenthesettingsatisfiescertainmildrestrictions. Definition10.4.6(Choice-setmonotonicity) An environment exhibits choice-set choice-set monotonicity if i, X X (removing any agent weakly decreases—that is, −i ∀ ⊆ monotonicity neverincreases—themechanism’ssetofpossiblechoicesX).

These assumptions are often quite reasonable, as we illustrate with two examples. First, considerrunningVCG to decidewhetherornotto undertakea public project such as building a road.
