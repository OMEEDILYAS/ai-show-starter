(We will considersuch restrictions in later sections.) Because mechanism design is most often studied in settings where agents’ preferencesare unknown, we start by defining a Bayesian game setting, basing it on the epistemic types definition of Bayesian games that wegaveinSection6.3.1. Thekeydifferenceisthatthesettingdoesnotincludeactionsfortheagents,andinsteaddefinestheutilityfunctionsoverthesetofpossible outcomes.2 Bayesiangame Definition10.2.1(Bayesiangamesetting) A Bayesian game setting is a tuple setting (N,O,Θ,p,u),where • N isafinitesetofnagents; • Oisasetofoutcomes; • Θ = Θ Θ isasetofpossiblejointtypevectors; 1 n ×···× • pisa(common-prior)probabilitydistributiononΘ;and • u = (u ,...,u ), where u : O Θ R is the utility function for each 1 n i × 7→ playeri.

Whilewe deferalengthierdiscussionofauctionstoChapter11,thebasicideaisasfollows. The designer wishes, for example, to ensure that the bidder with the highest valuation for a given item will win the auction, but the valuations of the agents are all private. The outcomes consist of allocating the item (in the case of a simple, single-item auction) to one of the agents, and having the agents make or receive some payments. The auction rules define the actions available to the agents (the “bidding rules”), and the mapping from action vectors to outcomes (“allocation rules”and“paymentrules”: whowinsandwhopayswhatasafunctionofthebidding). If we assume thatthe valuationsare drawnfrom some knowndistribution, eachparticularauctiondesignandparticularsetofagentsdefineaBayesiangame, inwhichthesignalofeachagentishisownvaluation. Finally, there exist implementation concepts that are satisfied by a larger set of strategy profiles than implementation in dominant strategies, but that are not guaranteedtobeachievableforanygivensocialchoicefunctionandsetofpreferences, unlike Bayes–Nashimplementation. For example, we could consideronly symmetric Bayes–Nash equilibria, on the principle that strategies that depend on agentidentities would be less likely to arise in practice. Itturns outthatsymmetric Bayes–Nash equilibria always exist in symmetric Bayesian games. A second implementation notion
