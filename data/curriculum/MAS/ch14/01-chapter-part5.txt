Butbeforemakingthisprecise,letusdiscussanalternative axiomatic characterization of belief revision operators. This is an axiomatic theory of consequence relations. By definition a meta-theory, this axiomatic theory consistsofrulesoftheform“ifderivationxisvalidthensoisderivationy.” It turns out that this meta-theoretic characterization lends particularly deep insight into belief dynamics.

There are however other metareasoning rules that hold for belief revision. Consider the following rules; in these we use the symbol to represent the fact that we are reasoning about
