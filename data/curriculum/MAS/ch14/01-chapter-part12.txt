Or,hemayobtainnew information that makes his trip to San Francisco infeasible, in which case too thatintentionmustbedropped. 7. Agentsneednotintendthe anticipatedsideeffectsoftheirintentions. Driving to San Francisco may necessarily increase one’s risk of a traffic accident, but an agent intending the former does not generally intend the latter.

Such event sequences will form the basis for reasoning about intentions and othernotions.Thelanguageweusetospeakaboutsucheventsisbasedondynamic logic. Dynamiclogictakes thebasicevents(suchas goingto the train station)as the primitive objects. These basic events can be combined in a number of ways to make complexevents; see later. By associating an agent with an event(where basic orcomplex)we get an action. Since we will notconsideragent-less events here,wewillusetheterm“event”and“action”interchangeably.

Interestingly, the language of actions and the language of states are mutually dependent.Theyaredefinedasfollows.
