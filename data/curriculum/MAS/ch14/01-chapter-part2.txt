The following example illustrates the definitions. Consider Figure 14.1. The interpretation of this structure is that each agent knows the truth of exactly one proposition: p for agent 1, and q for agent 2.

To begin with, we have implicitly assumed that the partitionstructureofeachagentiscommonknowledgeamongallagents. Second, we assumed that the beliefs of the agents are based on a common prior and are obtained by conditioning on the worlds in the partition. Both are substantive assumptions and have ramifications. For example, we have the fact that the beliefs of an agent are the same within all worlds of any given partition. Also note that wehaveastrongpropertyofdiscretenessinthehigher-orderbeliefs. Specifically, the numberof statements of the form “M,w = P (P (ϕ) = a) = b” in which i j | b > 0 is equalto atmostthe numberofpartitions foragentj, and thesum ofall b’sfromthesestatementsisequalto1.
