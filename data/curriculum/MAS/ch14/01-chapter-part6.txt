Ifit is not, one tries the second distribution, and so on until the probability is well defined. A standard example of this involves throwing a die. It may land on one of its six faces,withequalprobability. Thereisalsoapossibilitythatitwilllandononeof itstwelveedges;minusculeasthisprobabilityis,itisnonethelessapossibleevent. Finally, even more improbably, the die may land and stay perched on one of its eight corners.

But there are other forms of belief dynamics, and this section discusses some of them. Wedosomorebrieflythanwithbeliefrevision;attheendofthechapterwe providereferencestofurtherreadingsonthesetopics. Expansionandcontraction To begin with, there are two simple operations closely linked to revision that are beliefexpansion worth noting. Expansionis simply the addition of a belief, regardlessof whether it leads to a contradiction. The expansionof a theory K by a formula ϕ, written K +ϕ,isdefinedby K +ϕ = Cn(K ϕ ). ∪{ } belief Contraction is the operation of removing just
