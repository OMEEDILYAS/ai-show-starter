We will therefore not treat this subject matter with the same amount of detail as we did the earlier topics. Instead we will do the following. We will start with an informal discussion of notions such as intention andsomerequirementsonaformaltheoryofthem. Wewillthenoutlineonlythe syntax of one such theory, starting with a single-agent theory and then adding a multiagentcomponent. 14.4.1 Somepreformalintuitions Letusstartbyconsideringwhatwearetryingtoachieve.

Afterretrofitting, Hector is returned, marked “Model C: The Committed Assistant.” Again, Phil asks Hector to bring a beer. Again, it accedes, replying “Sure thing.” Then Phil asks, “What kind do we have?” It answers, “AnchorSteam.” Philsays, “Nevermind.” Oneminutelater, Hector trundles over with an Anchor Steam in its gripper.

In addition,we will considerthe commitment notions of desire, goal, and even agency. This scenario also suggests some concapability straints.

Goals in contrast goal must be consistent with each other, and furthermore must be believed to be agency achievable,orat least notbelievedto be unachievable. The same is true of intentions,whichhavetheadditionalpropertyofbeingpersistentintime. Loosely speaking,these three notionsform a hierarchy; goals imply desires, and intentions imply goals. These mutual constraints among the difference notions are rationalbalance sometimes called rational balance. In the formulation in the next section we willconsidergoalsandintentions,butnotdesires. 2.
