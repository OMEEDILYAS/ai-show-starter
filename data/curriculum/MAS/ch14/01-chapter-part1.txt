14 Beyond Belief: Probability, Dynamics and Intention Inthischapterwegobeyondthemodelofknowledgeandbeliefintroducedinthe previous chapter. Here we look at how one might represent statements such as “Mary believes that it will rain tomorrow with probability > .7,” and even “Bill knows that John believes with probability .9 that Mary believes with probability > .7 that it will rain tomorrow.” We will also look at rules that determine how theseknowledgeandbeliefstatements canchangeovertime, morebroadlyatthe connectionbetweenlogicandgames,andconsiderhowtoformalizethenotionof intention. 14.1 Knowledgeandprobability In a Kripke structure, each possible world is either possible or not possible for a givenagent,andanagentknows(orbelieves)asentencewhenthesentenceistrue in all of the worlds that are accessible for that agent. As a consequence, in this framework both knowledge and belief are binary notions in that agents can only believe or not believe a sentence (and similarly for knowledge). We would now like to adda quantitativecomponentto thepicture. Inourquantitativesettingwe willkeepthenotionofknowledgeasis,butwillbeabletomakestatementsabout the degree of an agent’s belief in a particular proposition. This will allow us to expressnotonlystatementsoftheform“theagentbelieveswithprobability.3that it will rain” but also statements of the form “agent i believes with probability .3 thatagentj believeswithprobability.9thatitwillrain.” Thesesortofstatements can becometricky if we are notcareful—forexample, what happensif i = j in thelastsentence?1 Thereareseveralwaysofformalizingaprobabilisticmodelofbeliefinamultiagentsetting,whichvaryintheirgenerality.

Definition14.1.1(Multiagentprobabilitystructure) Given a set X, let Π(X) be the class of all probability distributions over X. Then we define a (commoncommonprior prior)multiagentprobabilitystructure M overanonemptysetΦofprimitivepropositionsasthetuple(W,π,I ,...,I , ), 1 n P where • W isanonemptysetof possibleworlds; interpretation • π : Φ 2W is aninterpretationthatassociateswith eachprimitive proposi7→ tionp Φthesetofpossibleworldsw W inwhichpistrue; ∈ ∈ • EachI isapartitionrelation,justasintheoriginalpartitionmodel(seeDefii nition13.1.1);and • Π(W)isthecommonpriorprobability. P ∈ Adding the probability distribution does not change the set of worlds that an agent considers possible from a world w, but it does allow us to quantify how likely an agent considers each of these possible worlds. In world w, agent i can conditiononthefactthatitisinthepartitionI(w)todeterminetheprobabilitythat itisineachw′ I(w).
