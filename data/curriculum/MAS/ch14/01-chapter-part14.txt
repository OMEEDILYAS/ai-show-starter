Theoriesofbeliefdynamics—revision,update,andbeyond—arecoveredinPappas [2007], as well as in the older but still excellent Gärdenfors and Rott [1995]. Early seminal work includes that of Gärdenfors [1988], Alchourron, Gärdenfors and Makinson [1985] (after whom “AGM revision” is named), and Katsuno and Mendelzon [1991], who introduced the distinction between belief revision and belief update. The material in the chapter on knowledge, certainty, and belief is based on Boutilier [1992] and Lamarre and Shoham [1994]. The material in the section on belief fusion is based on Maynard-Reid and Shoham [2001] and Maynard-Zhangand Lehmann [2003].
