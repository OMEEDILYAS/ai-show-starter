other depending on the subject matter. Various theories exist to capture this beliefarbitration intuition. Oneofthemisthetheoryofbeliefarbitration,whichtakesanegalitarian approach: it does not favor either of the two sides over the other.

Wenowconsiderwhathappenswhenthesecondargumentisalso abeliefstate. The first question to ask is what does it mean intuitively to take a second belief state as an argument. Here again the multiagent perspective is useful. We think of a belief set as describing “current” beliefs and a belief state as describing “conditional”(i.e., “current” as well as “hypothetical”)beliefs. Accordingto UncorrectedmanuscriptofMultiagentSystems,publishedbyCambridgeUniversityPress Revision1.1©Shoham&Leyton-Brown,2009,2010. 14.2 Dynamicsofknowledgeandbelief 451 AGMrevision,then,thebelieverhasaccesstohisfullconditionalbeliefs,butthe informer reveals only (some of his) current beliefs. However, one could imagine situations in which the informer engages in “full disclosure,” revealing not only allhiscurrentbeliefsbutalsoallhishypotheticalones. Whenthisisthecase,the believeris faced with the task of merging two belief states; this process is called belieffusion. Belieffusioncallsforresolvingconflictsamongthetwobeliefstates. Fromthe technicalstandpoint, the basic unitof conflict here is no longerthe inconsistency oftwobeliefs,butrathertheinconsistencyofthetwoorderingsonpossibleworlds. Hereis howonetheoryresolvessuchconflicts; we presentit insomedetailsince itveryexplicitlyadoptsamultiagentperspective. To developintuition for the following definitions, imagine a set ofinformation sourcesandasetofagents. Thesourcescanbethoughtofasprimitiveagentswith fixed belief states. Each source informs some of the agents of its belief state; in effect,eachsourceofferstheopinionthatcertainworldsaremorelikelythanothers andremainsneutralaboutotherpairs. An agent’s belief state is simply the amalgamation of all these opinions, each annotatedbyitsorigin(or“pedigree”).Ofcourse,theseopinionsingeneralconflict with one another. To resolvethese conflicts, the agentplaces a strict “credibility” ranking on the sources and accepts the highest-ranked opinion offered on every pairofworlds.
