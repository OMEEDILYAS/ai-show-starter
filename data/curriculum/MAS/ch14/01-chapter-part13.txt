We first strengthen the notion of having a goal. The G operator defines a weak i notion; in particular, it includes goals that are already satisfied and thus provides achievement noimpetusforaction.

Recallthatanagentmayintendeithertodoanactionortoachieveastate. For this reason, we give two definitions of intention. The following is a definition of intendinganaction.

The second definition captures the intention to bring about a state with certain properties. Definition14.4.6 IntendS i(ϕ) def PGoal i eJustDid i(B i ( e′AboutToDo i(e′;ϕ?)) ≡ ∃ ∃ ∧ G i ( AboutToDo i(e;ϕ?))?;e;ϕ?)) ¬ ¬ We explain this definition in a number of steps. Notice that to intend a state in which ϕ holds, an agentis committedto takinga numberofactions e himself, afterwhichϕholds. However,inordertoavoidallowinghimtointendϕbydoing something accidentally, we require that he believe he is about to do some series ofeventse′ thatbrings aboutϕ.

We will not discuss the pros and cons of this line of definitions further, nor alternative definitions; the notes at the end of the chapter provide references to these. Let us just note
