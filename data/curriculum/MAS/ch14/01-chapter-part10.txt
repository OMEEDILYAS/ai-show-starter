operators action operators are indexed by a logical proposition, denoting, for example, the learning of that proposition. In Section 14.5 we provide some references to this literature. 14.3 Logic, games,andcoalitionlogic So far in this chapter we looked at the use of logic to reason about purely “informational" aspects of agents. Now we broaden the discussion to include also Freeforon-screenuse;pleasedonotdistribute.Youcangetanotherfreecopy ofthisPDFororderthebookathttp://www.masfoundations.org. 454 14 BeyondBelief:Probability,DynamicsandIntention “motivational"aspects. Inthissectionwe(briefly)lookattheinteractionbetween modallogicandgametheory. The connection between logic and games is multifaceted. Even before the adventofmodern-daygametheory,inthecontextofclassicallogic,itwasproposed thatalogicalsystembeviewedasagamebetweenaprover(the“asserter")anda disprover(the “respondent"),with a sentencebeing valid if the proverhad a winningstrategy. Inthiscase,gamesareusedtoreasonaboutlogic. Butmuchrecent work has been aimed in the opposite direction, with logic being used to reason aboutgames. Here games are meant in the formal sense of modern game theory, andthelogicsaremodalratherthanclassical. We have so far seen how modal logic can be used to model and reason about agents’ knowledge and the beliefs and how those change in time. But modal logic can be used to reason also about their actions, preferences, and hence also aboutgames and (certain) solution concepts. Much of the literature here focuses onextensive-formgamesofbothperfectandimperfect(thoughnotyetincomplete) information.Thereexistsarapidlyexpandingliteratureonthetopicwhichissomewhatcomplex. Wewilljustmentionherethattheselogicsallowustoreasonabout certain solution concepts, particularly those involving only pure strategies.

Forexample, clearly, both [C] and [C] are valid (no coalition can force a contradiction, ¬ ⊥ ⊤ and tautologies are true in any model, and thus in any set forced by a coalition). Equally intuitively, [C](ϕ ϕ ) [C]ϕ is also valid (after all, if a coalition 1 2 2 ∧ → can enforce an outcome to lie within a given set of worlds, it can also enforce it to lie within a superset). Perhaps more insightful is the following valid
