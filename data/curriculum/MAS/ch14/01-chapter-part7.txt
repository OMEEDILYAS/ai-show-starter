Similar to revision, it incorporates newevidenceintoanexistingbeliefstate,ensuringthatconsistencyismaintained. But the intuition behind update is subtly different from the intuition underlying revision. In revision, the second argument represents new evidence of facts that were true all along. In update, the second argument represents facts that have possiblybecometrueonlyaftertheoriginalbeliefswereformed.

There are certainly situations in which new evidence is not necessarily given precedence over existing beliefs. Indeed, from the multiagent perspective, each revisioncanbeseenasinvolvingatleasttwoagents—thebelieverandtheinformer. When synthesizing a new belief, the believer may wish to accord himself higher priority, to not favor one of them over the other, or to give priority to one over the
