Intuitively, the nodes in the graph represent the players, andthe valueofa coalitionis obtainedby summingtheweights ofthe edges that connectpairs of vertices correspondingto members of the coalition. WGGs thus explicitly model pairwise synergies among players and assume that all such synergiesincreasethecoalition’svalueadditively.
