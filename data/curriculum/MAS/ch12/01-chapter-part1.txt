Teams of Selfish Agents: An 12 Introduction to Coalitional Game Theory InChapters1and2welookedathowteamsofcooperativeagentscanaccomplish more together than they can achieve in isolation. Then, in Chapter 3 and many of the chapters that followed, we looked at how self-interested agents make individualchoices. Inthischapterweinterpolatebetweenthesetwoextremes,asking howself-interestedagentscancombinetoformeffectiveteams. Asthetitleofthe chaptersuggests,thischapterisessentiallyacrashcourseincoalitionalgametheory, also knownas cooperativegametheory. As was mentionedat the beginning of Chapter 3, when we introduced noncooperative game theory, the term “cooperative” can be misleading. It does not mean that, as in Chapters 1 and 2, each agentis agreeableandwill followarbitraryinstructions. Rather,it meansthatthe basic modelingunitis the groupratherthan the individualagent. More precisely, in coalitionalgametheory we still modelthe individualpreferenceof agents, but nottheirpossibleactions. Instead, we havea coarsermodelofthe capabilitiesof differentgroups. Weproceedasfollows. First,wedefinethemostwidelystudiedmodelofcoalitional games, give examples of situations that can be modeled in this way, and discuss a series of refinements to the model. Then we consider how such games can be analyzed. The main solution concepts we discuss here are the Shapley value,thecore,andthenucleolus. Finally,weconsidercompactrepresentationsof coalitionalgamesandtheircomputationalimplications.
