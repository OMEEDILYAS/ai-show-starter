Note that superadditivity implies that the value of the entiresetofplayers(the“grandcoalition”)isnolessthanthesumofthevalueof any nonoverlappingset of coalitions. In other words, the grand coalition has the highestpayoffamongallcoalitionalstructures. Alloftheexampleswegaveearlier describesuperadditivegames. Taking noninterference across coalitions to the extreme, when coalitions can neveraffectoneanother,eitherpositivelyornegatively,thenwehaveadditive(or inessential)games. additivegame Definition12.1.7(Additivegame) A game G = (N,v) is additive (or inessential)ifforallS,T N,ifS T = ,thenv(S T) = v(S)+v(T). ⊂ ∩ ∅ ∪ Arelatedclassofgamesisthatofconstant-sumgames. constant-sum Definition12.1.8(Constant-sumgame) A game G = (N,v) is constant sum if game forallS N,v(S)+v(N S) = v(N). ⊂ \ Notethateveryadditivegameis necessarilyconstantsum, butnotviceversa.

While convex games may therefore appear to be a very specialized class of coalitional games, thesegamesareactuallynotsorareinpractice. Forexample,theAirportgameas described in Example 12.1.3 is convex. Convex games have a number of useful properties,aswewilldiscussinthenextsection.
