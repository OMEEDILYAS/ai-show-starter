Canwecharacterizewhenacoalitionalgamehasanonemptycore? Fortunately, that at least is possible. To do so, we first need to define a concept known as balancedness. Definition12.2.10(Balancedweights) Asetofnonnegativeweights(over2N),λ, balancedset isbalancedif i N, λ(S) = 1. ∀ ∈ S:i∈S X Intuitively, the weights on the coalitions involving any givenagent i can be interpretedastheconditionalprobabilitiesthatthesecoalitionswillform,giventhat iwillbelongtoacoalition.

Considerthelinearfeasibilityproblemusedtocomputethecore,given inEquation(12.1). Wecanconstructthefollowinglinearprogram: minimize x i i∈N X subjectto x v(S) S N i ≥ ∀ ⊆ i∈S X Note that when the value of this program is no bigger than v(N), then the payoff vector x is feasible, and belongs to the core. Indeed, the value of the program is equal to v(N) if and only if the core is nonempty. Now consider thislinearprogram’sdual. maximize λ(S)v(S) S⊆N X subjectto λ(S) = 1 i N ∀ ∈ S⊆N X λ(S) 0 S N ≥ ∀ ⊆ Notethatthelinearconstraintsinthedualensurethatλisbalanced. Byweak duality,theoptimalvalueofthedualisatmosttheoptimalvalueoftheprimal, andhencethecoreis nonemptyifandonlyifthe optimalvalueofthe dualis nogreaterthanv(N). While the Bondereva–Shapleytheorem completely characterizes when a coalitional game has a nonempty core, it is not always easy or feasible to check that a game satisfies Equation (12.2) for all balanced sets of weights. Luckily, there existseveralresults that allow us to predictthe emptiness ornonemptinessofthe corebasedonacoalitionalgame’smembershipinoneoftheclasseswedefinedin Section12.1.3.

WenowconsideranapplicationofthecoretoourAuctiongame(Example12.1.5). Earlierweaskedwhetheranycoalition(consistingofbiddersandtheseller)could do better than the payoffs they receive when everyone participates in the mechanism. Now that we have defined the core, we can see that the question can be rephrasedas asking whetherthe seller’s and the agents’payoffs from the auction areinthecore. First,letusconsiderthecaseofsingle-item,second-priceauctions.Ifthebidders follow their weakly dominant strategy of truthful reporting, it turns out that the payoffs are always in the core. This is because the seller receives revenue equal toorgreaterthanthevaluationsofallthelosingbidders(specifically,equaltothe second-highestvaluation),andhencecannotenticeanyofthelosingbidderstopay himmore. Now let us consider the case of the VCG mechanism applied to combinatorial auctions. Interestingly, though this mechanism generalizes the second-price auction discussed earlier, it does not guarantee payoffs from the core. For example, consideranauctionwiththreebiddersandtwogoodsxandy,withthefollowing valuations. Bidder1 Bidder2 Bidder3 v (x,y)=90 v (x)=v (x,y)=100 v (y)=v (x,y)=100 1 2 2 3 3 v (x)=v (y)=0 v (y)=0 v (x)=0 1 1 2 3 The efficient allocationawards x to bidder2 and y to bidder3. Neither bidder ispivotal,sobothpay0. However,bothbidder1andthesellerwouldbenefitfrom forming a coalition in which bidder1 wins the bundle x,y and pays any amount 0< p < 90. ThusinacombinatorialauctiontheVCGpayoffsarenotguaranteed 1 tobelongtothecore.
