The ∧ coalitional game represented has two agents, a and b, and the following value function. v( ) = 0 v( a ) = 0 ∅ { } v( b ) = 2 v( a,b ) = 5+2= 7 { } { } An alternative interpretation of MC-nets is a graphical representation. We can treattheagentsasnodesonagraph,andforeachpattern,acliqueisdrawnonthe graph for the agents that appear in the same pattern. The weight of a rule is the weightassociatedwiththecorrespondingclique. A natural question for a representation language is whether there is a limit on theclassofobjectsitcanrepresent. Proposition12.3.17 MC-nets can representany game when negative literals are allowed in the patterns or when the weights can be negative. When the patterns are limited to conjunctive formula over positive literals and the weights are nonnegative,MC-netscanrepresentallandonlyconvexgames. Intuitively,whennegativeliteralsareallowed,wecanspecifythevalueofeach coalition S directly by having a booleanformula that can be satisfied if and only if the truth assignment corresponds to the characteristic vector of S, and hence arbitrarygamescanberepresented. Another question is how a language relates to other representation languages. We can show that MC-nets generalize two of the previously discussed representations: WGGs and the multi-issue representation. First, MC-nets can be viewed as a generalization of WGGs that assigns weights to hyper-edges rather than to simpleedges. A patternin this casespecifiesthe agentsthatsharethe sameedge. However,sinceMC-netscanrepresentanycoalitionalgames,MC-netsconstitutea strictgeneralizationofWGGs. Second,MC-netsgeneralizethemulti-issuerepresentation. Eachissueisrepresentedbypatternsthatonlyinvolveagentsrelevantto theissue. Comparingthetworepresentations,MC-netsrequireatmostO(n)more space than the multi-issue representation; however, there exist coalitional games forwhichMC-netsareexponentiallymoresuccinct(inthenumberofagents)than themulti-issuerepresentation.

In some situations, this assumption is not reasonable, for example, dueto legalreasons(agentscannotengagein side payments), orbecausethe agents do not have access to a common currency. Such settings are described as nontransferableutility(NTU)games. Definition12.4.1(Coalitionalgamewithnontransferableutility) A coalitional coalitionalgame game(withnontransferableutility)isapair(N,v),where with nontransferable • N isafinitesetofplayers,indexedbyi;and utility • v : 2N 2R|S| associateseachcoalitionS N with asetofvaluevectors v(S) 7→R|S|,whichcanbeinterpretedasthed ⊆ ifferentsetsofpayoffsthatS is ⊆ abletoachieveforeachofitsmembers.
