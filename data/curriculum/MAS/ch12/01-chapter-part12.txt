and core was explored, forexample,byDayandMilgrom[2008]. The first systematic investigation of the computational complexity of solution concepts in coalitional game theory were carried out in Deng and Papadimitriou [1994]. This paper defined weighted graph games and studied the complexity of computing the core and the Shapley value, as well as a few of the other solution concepts we mentioned. For weighted voting games, a systematic study of the computationalcomplexityofthevarioussolutionconceptshaveappearedinElkind et al. [2007]. Languages for succinct representation of coalitional games have been developed mostly in the AI community. The superadditive representation was developed by Conitzer and Sandholm [2003a]; it also naturally extends to representing superadditive games with nontransferable utilities. The multi-issue representationwasalsodevelopedbyConitzerandSandholm[2004].Themarginal contribution nets representation was first proposed in Ieong and Shoham [2005], andlatergeneralizedinIeongandShoham[2006].
