(Indeed, this solution concept has also been applied in settings where there is no uncertaintyabout agents’types.) A third usage even more stringently requires that no agent ever play a mixed strategy. Both of these definitions can be useful, e.g., in the context of mechanism design (see Chapter 10).

Formally, a congestiongameis single-shotn-playergame, defined asfollows. congestiongame Definition6.4.1(Congestiongame) A congestion game is a tuple (N,R,A,c), where • N isasetofnagents; • Risasetofr resources; • A = A A , whereA 2R is thesetof actionsfor agenti; 1 n i ×···× ⊆ \{∅} and • c = (c ,...,c ),wherec :N Risacostfunctionforresourcek R. 1 r k 7→ ∈ Theplayers’utilityfunctionsaredefinedintermsofthecostfunctionsc .

One motivating example for this formulation is a computer network in which severalusers want to send a message from one node to anotherat approximately the same time. Each link connectingtwo nodesis a resource,and an action fora useris to selecta path of links connectingtheir sourceand target node. The cost function for each resource expresses the latency on each link as a function of its congestion.

Wedefertheproofforthemoment,thoughwenotethatthepropertyisimportant because mixed-strategy equilibria are open to criticisms that they are less likely than pure-strategy equilibria to arise in practice. Furthermore, this theorem tells us that if we want to compute a sample Nash equilibrium of a congestion game, myopic we can look for a pure-strategy equilibrium. Consider the myopic best-response best-response process,describedinFigure6.12. Bythedefinitionofequilibrium,MYOPICBESTRESPONSEreturnsapure-strategy Nashequilibriumifitterminates.
