Observethat multiple action profiles might give rise to the same configuration, because configurations simply count the number of agents who took each action withoutworryingaboutwhichagenttookwhichaction.

Recall that we saw such structure incongestiongames(Section6.4). Intuitively, we will usethe edgesofthe action graphto denotecontext-specific independencerelationsinthegame. Justaswedidwithgraphicalgames,wewill defineautility functionthatdependsontheactionstakenin somelocalneighborhood. As it was for graphical games, the neighborhoodν will be defined by the edges E; indeed, we will use exactly the same definition (Definition 6.5.6). In action graph games the idea will be that the payoff of a player playing an action α only depends on the configuration over the neighbors of α.13 We must ∈ A therefore define notation for such a configuration overa neighborhood. Let C(α) denotethesetofallrestrictionsofconfigurationstotheelementscorrespondingto theneighborhoodofα .

Summing up, we can state the formal definition of action-graph games as follows. action-graph Definition6.5.11 Anaction-graphgame(AGG)isatuple(N,A,( ,E),u),where A game(AGG) • N isthesetofagents; • A = A A ,whereA isthesetofactionsavailabletoagenti; 1 n i ×···× • ( ,E) isanactiongraph,where = A is thesetofdistinctactions; A A i∈N i and S 13.

IntheRoadgame,sinceeachnodehasatmostfourincomingedges,we onlyneedto storeO(n4) numbersforeachnode,and O( n4)numbersforthe |A| entire game. In general, when the in-degree of the action graph is bounded by a constant,thespacecomplexityoftheAGGrepresentationispolynomialinn. Likegraphicalgames,AGGsarefullyexpressive.Arbitrarynormal-formgames canberepresentedasAGGswithnonoverlappingactionsets. Graphicalgamescan be encodedin the same way, but with a sparseredge structure. Indeed, the AGG encodingofagraphicalgameisjustascompactastheoriginalgraphicalgame. Althoughitissomewhatinvolvedtoshowwhythisistrue,AGGshavethetheoreticalpropertieswehavecometoexpectfromacompactrepresentation. Theorem6.5.12 Given an AGG, EXPECTEDUTILITY can be computed in time polynomialin the size of the AGG representationby an algorithm representedas anarithmetic circuitas requiredbyTheorem6.5.3. In particular, if the in-degree oftheactiongraphisboundedbyaconstant,thetimecomplexityispolynomialin n. The AGG representation can be extendedto include function nodes, which are specialnodesintheactiongraphthatdonotcorrespondtoactions. Foreachfunction node p, c is defined as a deterministic function of the configuration of its p neighborsν(p). Functionnodescanbeusedtorepresentautility function’sintermediateparameters,allowingthecompactrepresentationofgameswithadditional forms of independence structure. Computationally, when a game with function nodes has the property that each player affects the configuration c independently, EXPECTEDUTILITY canstillbecomputedinpolynomialtime. AGGscanalsobe extendedtoexploitadditivityinplayers’utility functions. Givenbothoftheseextensions, AGGs are able to compactly represent a broad array of realistic games, includingcongestiongames. 6.5.4 Multiagentinfluencediagrams multiagent Multiagentinfluencediagrams(MAIDs)areageneralizationofinfluencediagrams influence (IDs),acompactrepresentationfordecision-theoreticreasoninginthesingle-agent diagrams case.
