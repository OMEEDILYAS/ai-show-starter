Thenweobtain thefollowingresult. Theorem6.5.4 TheproblemofcomputingaNashequilibriuminbehavioralstrategies in an extensive-form game can be polynomially reduced to finding a Nash equilibriuminatwo-playernormal-formgame. This shows that the speedups we achieved by using the sequence form in Section 5.2.3were not achievedsimply because ofinefficiency in our algorithms for normal-formgames.Instead,thereisafundamentalcomputationalbenefittoworking with extensive-form games, at least when we restrict ourselves to behavioral strategies. Fast algorithms for solving EXPECTEDUTILITY are useful for more than just demonstratingtheworst-casecomplexityoffindingaNashequilibriumforagame representation. EXPECTEDUTILITY is also a bottleneck step in several practical algorithmsforcomputingNashequilibria,suchastheGovindan–Wilsonalgorithm or simplicial subdivision methods (see Section 4.3). Plugging a fast method for solving EXPECTEDUTILITY into one of these algorithms offers a simple way of morequicklycomputingaNashequilibriumofacompactlyrepresentedgame.

Theorem6.5.5 If a game representation has polynomial type and has a polynomialalgorithmforcomputingEXPECTEDUTILITY, thenacorrelatedequilibrium canbecomputedinpolynomialtime. The attentive reader may recall that we have already showed (in Section 4.6) that correlated equilibria can be identified in polynomialtime by solving a linear program(Equations(4.52)–(4.54)). Thus,Theorem6.5.5maynotseemveryinteresting. Thecatch,aswithexpectedutility,isthatwhilethisLPhassizepolynomial insizeofthenormalform,itssizewouldbeexponentialinthesizeofmanycompact representations.
