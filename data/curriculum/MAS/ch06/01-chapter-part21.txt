Graphical j −j j −j j j ∈ j games can represent any game, but of course they are not always compact. The spacecomplexityoftherepresentationisexponentialinthesizeofthelargestν(i). In the example above the size of the largest ν(i) is 4, and this is independent of the total number of agents. As a result, the graphical game representation of the example requires space polynomialin n, while a normal-form representation wouldrequirespaceexponentialinn. The following is sufficient to show that the properties we discussed above in Section6.5.1holdforgraphicalgames. Lemma6.5.8 The EXPECTEDUTILITY problem can be computed in polynomial timeforgraphicalgames,andsuchanalgorithmcanbetranslatedtoanarithmetic circuitasrequiredbyTheorem6.5.3.

Forexample,whenthegraph(N,E)definesatree,amessage-passingalgorithmcalled NASHPROP cancomputeanǫ-Nashequilibriumintimepolynomialin1/ǫandthe size of the representation. NASHPROP consists of two phases: a “downstream” pass in which messages are passed from the leaves to the root and then an “upstream”passinwhichmessagesarepassedfromtherootto theleaves. Whenthe graph is a path, a similar algorithm can find an exact equilibrium in polynomial time. Wemayalsobeinterestedinfindingpure-strategyNashequilibria. Determining whether a pure-strategy equilibrium exists in a graphical game is NP-complete. However, the problem can be formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem (or alternativelyas a Markovrandomfield)and solvedusing standardalgorithms. In particular,whenthe graphhasconstanttreewidth,12 the problemcanbe solvedin polynomialtime. Graphicalgameshavealso beenusefulasa theoreticaltool.

Suppose each of the n agents is interested in opening a business (say a coffee shop), and can choose to locate in any block along either side of a road. Multipleagentscanchoosethesameblock. Agenti’spayoffdependsonthe numberofagentswho chosethe sameblock as he did, as well as the numbersof agentswho chose eachof the adjacentblocks ofland. This gamehas an obvious graphicalstructure, which is illustrated in Figure 6.17. Here nodescorrespondto actions, and each edge indicates that an agent who takes one action affects the payoffsofotheragentswhotakesomesecondaction. T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 T7 T8 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 Figure6.17: ModifiedRoadgame. Notice that any pair of agents can potentially affect each other’s payoffs by choosingthesameoradjacentlocations. Thismeansthatthegraphicalgamerepresentationofthis gameis aclique, andthespacecomplexityofthisrepresentation is the same as that of the normal form (exponential in n). The problem is that graphical games are only compact for games with strict payoff independencies: thatis,wherethereexistpairsofplayerswhocannever(directly)affecteachother. Thisgameexhibitscontext-specificindependenceinstead: whethertwoagentsare abletoaffecteachother’spayoffsdependsontheactionstheychoose. Theactiongraph game (AGG) representation exploits this kind of context-specific independence. Intuitively,this representationis builtaroundthe graphstructureshownin Figure6.17.
