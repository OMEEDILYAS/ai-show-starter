Extensiveformwithchancemoves A second way of capturing the common prior is to hypothesize a special agent called Nature who makes probabilistic choices. While we could have Nature’s 5.

Naturedoesnothave a utility function (or, alternatively, can be viewed as having a constant one), and has the unique strategy of randomizing in a commonly known way. The agents receive individual signals about Nature’s choice, and these are captured by their informationsetsinastandardway. Theagentshavenoadditionalinformation;in particular,theinformationsetscapturethefactthatagentsmaketheirchoiceswithout knowing the choices of others. Thus, we have reduced games of incomplete information to games of imperfect information, albeit ones with chance moves. These chance moves of Nature require minor adjustments of existing definitions, replacingpayoffsbytheirexpectationsgivenNature’smoves.6 For example, the Bayesian game of Figure 6.7 can be represented in extensive formasdepictedinFigure6.8.

Although this second definition of Bayesian games can be initially more intuitivethanourfirst definition,it canalso bemorecumbersometo workwith. This is becausewe use anextensive-formrepresentationin a settingwhere playersare unabletoobserveeachothers’moves.

Thisdefinitioncanseemmysterious, because the notion of type can be rather opaque. In general, the type of agent encapsulatesalltheinformationpossessedbytheagentthatisnotcommonknowledge. This is oftenquitesimple(e.g.,theagent’sknowledgeofhisprivatepayoff function),butcanalso includehis beliefs aboutotheragents’payoffs,abouttheir beliefsabouthisownpayoff,andanyotherhigher-orderbeliefs. We can get further insight into the notion of a type by relating it to the formulation at the beginning of this section. Consider again the Bayesian game in Figure 6.7. For each of the agents we have two types, corresponding to his two informationsets.
