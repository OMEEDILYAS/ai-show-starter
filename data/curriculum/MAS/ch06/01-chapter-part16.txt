we can see from the proof that it is not even necessary thatagentsbestrespondateverystep. Thealgorithmwillstillconvergetoapurestrategy Nash equilibrium by the same argument as long as agents deviate to a better response. On the other hand, it has recently been shown that the problem offindingapureNashequilibriuminacongestiongameisPLS-complete: ashard to find as any other object whose existence is guaranteed by a potential function argument. Intuitively, this means that our problem is as hard as finding a local minimumina travelingsalesmanproblemusinglocalsearch.

Overloading ai∈Ai i i i i 6∈ i notation,we write as s the amountofcongestioninducedon resourcer R by r P ∈ actiondistributions: s = ρ (a ,r)s(a ). r i i i X i∈Na Xi∈Ai We can now express the utility function.

First, the attentive reader will have noticed that we have glossed over the difference between actions and strategies. This is to simplify notation, and because we will only be concerned with pure-strategy equilibria. We do note that results exist concerning mixed-strategy equilibria of nonatomic congestion games; see the references cited at the end of the chapter. Second,wesayonlythatanactiondistributionarisesinanequilibriumbecausean actiondistributiondoesnotidentifytheactiontakenbyeveryindividualagent,and hence cannotconstitute an equilibrium.
