Intuitively, because the players are nonatomic, any mixed-strategy equilibrium corresponds to an “equivalent” pure-strategy equilibrium where the number of agents playing a given action is the expected number under the original equilibrium. 6.4.5 Selfishroutingandthepriceofanarchy selfishrouting Selfishroutingisamodelofhowself-interestedagentswouldroutetrafficthrough acongestednetwork.

Definingselfishrouting First, let us formally define the problem. Let G = (V,E) be a directed graph havingnsource–sinkpairs(s ,t ),...,(s ,t ).

These properties allow us to ask an interesting question: howsimilaristheoptimalsocialcosttothesocialcostunderanequilibriumaction distribution? priceofanarchy Definition6.4.11(Priceofanarchy) Thepriceofanarchyofanonatomiccongestion game (N,µ,R,A,ρ,c) havingequilibrium s and socialcost minimizing actiondistributions∗ isdefinedas C(s) unlessC(s∗) = 0, inwhichcasetheprice C(s∗) ofanarchyisdefinedtobe1. Intuitively, the price of anarchy is the proportion of additional social cost that is incurred because of agents’ self-interested behavior. When this ratio is close to 1 for a selfish routing problem, one can conclude that the agents are routing trafficaboutaswellaspossible,giventhetrafficratesandnetworkstructure. When this ratio is large, however, the agents’ selfish behavior is causing significantly suboptimalnetworkperformance.

There are two paths from s to t, one of which is relatively slow but 1 immunetocongestion,andtheotherofwhichhascongestion-dependentcost. Consider first the linear version of the problem given in Figure 6.14 (left). It is not hard to see that the Nash equilibrium is for all agents to choose the lower edge—indeed, this is a Nash equilibrium in dominant strategies. The social cost of this Nash equilibrium is 1. Consider what would happen if we required half ofthe agentsto choosethe upperedge,andthe otherhalfoftheagentsto choose theloweredge. Inthiscasethesocialcostwouldbe3/4, becausehalftheagents wouldcontinueto paya costof 1, while halfthe agentswould now paya costof 10.
