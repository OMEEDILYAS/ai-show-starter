Now the game may be analyzed straightforwardly. For example, we can determinethatplayer1’sbestresponsetoRLisDU.

Notethatfortherowplayer,DU isstillabestresponsetoRL;whathaschanged is how much better it is compared to the other three strategies.

There are also efficient computational techniques for computing sample equilibria of imperfect-information extensive-form games with chance nodes.

Theexpost equilibriumis thussimilarin flavortoequilibriaindominantstrategies,whichdo notrequireagentstobelievethatotheragentsactrationally. Indeed,manydominantstrategyequilibriaarealsoexpostequilibria,makingit easytobelievethatthisrelationshipalwaysholds. Infact,itdoesnot,asthefollowing exampleshows. Considera two-playerBayesian game where each agenthas twoactionsandtwocorrespondingtypes( ,A = Θ = H,L )distributed i∈N i i ∀ { } uniformly( ,P(θ = H) = 0.5), andwiththesameutilityfunctionforeach i∈N i ∀ agenti: 10 a = θ = θ ; i −i i u (a,θ) = 2 a = θ = θ ; i  i −i 6 i 0 otherwise.  In this game, each agent has a dominant strategy of choosing the action that cor-  respondsto his type, a = θ .

Finally, we note that the term “ex post equilibrium” has been used in several different ways in the literature. One alternate usage
