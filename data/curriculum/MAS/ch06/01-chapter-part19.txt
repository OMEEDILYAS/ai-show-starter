Theorem6.4.13 It is NP-complete to determine whether there exists any set of edgeswhoseremovalfrom aselfish routingproblemwouldreducethe socialcost inequilibrium. In particular, this result implies that identifying the optimal set of edges to removefrom a selfish routing problem in orderto minimize the socialcost in equilibriumisalsoNP-complete. Ofcourse,itisalwayspossibletoreduceanetwork’ssocialcostinequilibrium byreducingalloftheedgecosts.

Theorem6.4.14 Let Γ be a selfish routing problem, and let Γ′ be identical to Γ except that each edge cost c (x) is replaced by c′(x) = c (x/2)/2.

Thisresultsuggeststhatwhenitisrelativelyinexpensivetospeedupanetwork, doing so can have more significant benefits than getting agents to change their behavior. Finally, we will briefly mention two other methods of reducing social cost in Stackelberg equilibrium. First, in so-called Stackelbergrouting a small fraction of agents are routing routedcentrally,andtheremainingpopulationofagentsisfreetochoosetheirown actions.

In thissectionweexploresomecomputationallymotivatedalternativerepresentations thatallowcertainlargegamestobecompactlydescribedandalsomakeitpossible to efficiently find an equilibrium. The first two representations, graphical games and action-graph games, apply to normal-form games, while the following two, multiagent influence diagrams and the GALA language, apply to extensive-form games. 6.5.1 Theexpectedutilityproblem Webeginbydefiningaproblemthatisfundamentaltothediscussionofcomputationallymotivatedcompactrepresentations.

This is because our simple algorithm given by Equation (6.8) requires time exponentialin the size of such more compact representations. Thetrickwithcompactrepresentations,therefore,willnotbesimplyfinding some way of representing payoffs compactly—indeed, there are any number of schemesfrom the compressionliterature that could achievethis goal. Rather, we willwanttheadditionalpropertythatthecompactnessoftherepresentationcanbe leveragedbyanefficientalgorithmforcomputingEXPECTEDUTILITY. The first challenge is to ensure that the inputs to EXPECTEDUTILITY can be specifiedcompactly. polynomialtype Definition6.5.2(Polynomialtype) A game representation has polynomial type if the number of agents n and the sizes of the action sets A are polynomially i | | boundedinthesizeoftherepresentation.
