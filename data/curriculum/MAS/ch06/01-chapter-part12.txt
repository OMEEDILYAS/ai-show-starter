(Observe that agents’ types may be correlated.) Because uncertainty over mixed strategies was already handled in the ex post case, we can also write ex interimexpectedutilityasaweightedsumofEU (s,θ)terms. i Finally, there is the ex ante case, where we compute i’s expected utility under thejointmixedstrategyswithoutobservinganyagents’types. exanteexpected Definition6.3.5(Exanteexpectedutility) Agent i’s ex ante expected utility in utility a Bayesian game (N,A,Θ,p,u), where the agents’ strategies are given by the mixed-strategyprofiles,isdefinedas EU (s)= p(θ) s (a θ ) u (a,θ), (6.4) i j j j i | ! θ∈Θ a∈A j∈N X X Y orequivalentlyas EU (s) = p(θ)EU (s,θ), (6.5) i i θ∈Θ X oragainequivalentlyas EU (s) = p(θ )EU (s,θ ).
