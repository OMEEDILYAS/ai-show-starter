6 Richer Representations: Beyond the Normal and Extensive Forms Inthischapterwewillgobeyondthenormalandextensiveformsbyconsideringa varietyofrichergamerepresentations.

Forexample,wemaywanttoconsider whathappenswhenasimplenormal-formgamesuchasthePrisoner’sDilemmais repeatedinfinitely. We might want to considera game played by an uncountably infinite set of agents. Or we may want to use an interval of the real numbers as eachplayer’sactionspace.1 Second,both ofthe representationswe havestudiedso farpresumethatagents have perfect knowledge of everyone’s payoffs. This seems like a poor model of many realistic situations, where, for example, agents might have private information that affects their own payoffs and other agents might have only probabilistic information about each others’ private information. An elaboration like this can haveabigimpact,becauseoneagent’sactionscandependonwhatheknowsabout anotheragent’spayoffs. Finally, asthenumbersofplayersandactionsinagamegrow—eveniftheyremain finite—games can quickly become far too large to reason about or even to write down using the representationswe have studied so far.

Itcanalsooccurbecauseofthenature ofthe problemdomain (e.g., while the world mayinvolvemanyagents, the numberofagentswhoareabletodirectlyaffectanygivenagent’spayoffis small). If we understandthe way in which agents’payoffs are structured, we can represent them much more compactly than we would be able to do using the normalorex1.

Inthischapterwewillpresentvariousdifferentrepresentationsthataddressthese limitations of the normal and extensive forms. In Section 6.1 we will begin by considering the special case of extensive-form games that are constructed by repeatedlyplayinganormal-formgameandthenwewillextendourconsiderationto thecasewherethenormalformisrepeatedinfinitely.

Finally,inSection6.5wewillconsiderrepresentationsthataremotivatedprimarily bycompactnessandbytheirusefulnessforpermittingefficientcomputation(e.g., of Nash equilibria). Such compact representations can extend any other existing representation, such as normal-form games, extensive-form games, or Bayesian games. 6.1 Repeated games Inrepeatedgames,agivengame(oftenthoughtofinnormalform)isplayedmultipletimesbythesamesetofplayers.

This representation of the repeated game, while intuitive, obscures some key factors. Do agents see what the other agents played earlier? Do they remember whattheyknew?

We answer these questions in two steps. We first consider the case in which the game is repeated a finite and commonly-known number of times. Then we consider the case in which the game is repeated infinitely often, or a finite but unknownnumberoftimes. 6.1.1 Finitelyrepeated games Onewaytocompletelydisambiguatethesemanticsofafinitelyrepeatedgameisto specifyitasanimperfect-informationgameinextensiveform.
