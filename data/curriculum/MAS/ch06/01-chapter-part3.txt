Thus, if r < v −i i i i thenscannotbeaNashequilibrium. Part 2: Since r is a feasible enforceable payoff profile, we can write it as r = (βa)u (a), where β and γ are nonnegativeintegers. (Recall i a∈A γ i a that α were required to be rational. So we can take γ to be their common a P denominator.)Sincethecombinationwasconvex,wehaveγ = β . a∈A a We are going to construct a strategy profile that will cycle through all outP comes a A of G with cycles of length γ, each cycle repeating action a ∈ exactly β times. Let (at) be such a sequence of outcomes. Let us define a a strategys ofplayer i to be a trigger versionof playing(at): if nobodydevii ates, then s plays at in period t.
