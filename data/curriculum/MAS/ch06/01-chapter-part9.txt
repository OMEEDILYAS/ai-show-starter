In contrast, Bayesian games, or games of incomplete information, allow us to represent players’ uncertainties about the very game being played.4 This uncertaintyis represented as a probability distribution overa set of possible games.

The beliefs of the different agents are posteriors, obtained by conditioning a commonprioronindividualprivatesignals. The second assumption is substantive, and we return to it shortly. The first is not particularly restrictive, although at first it might seem to be. One can imagine many other potential types of uncertainty that players might have about the game—howmanyplayersare involved,whatactionsare available to each player, and perhaps other aspects of the situation. It might seem that we have severely limited the discussion by ruling these out. However, it turns out that these other typesofuncertaintycanbereducedtouncertaintyonlyaboutpayoffsviaproblem reformulation. Forexample,imaginethatwe wantto modela situation in whichone playeris uncertainaboutthenumberofactionsavailabletotheotherplayers. Wecanreduce this uncertaintyto uncertaintyaboutpayoffs by paddingthe gamewith irrelevant actions.

Indeed, there is an isomorphism between Nash equilibria of the original game and the padded one. Thus the uncertainty about the strategy space can be reduced to uncertaintyaboutpayoffs. Usingsimilartactics,itcanbeshownthatitisalsopossibletoreduceuncertainty about other aspects of the game to uncertainty about payoffs only.
