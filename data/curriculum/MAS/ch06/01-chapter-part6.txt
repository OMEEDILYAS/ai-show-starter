we will incorporate this complexity as a cost into the agent’s utility function. This could reflect, for example, the implementation cost of a strategy or the cost to learn it. Whilewecannotshowtheoremssimilartothoseintheprecedingsection,itturns out that we can get mileage out of this idea even when we incorporate it in a minimal way. Specifically, an agent’s disutility for complexity will only play a tie-breakingrole.

We can also show several interesting properties of the equilibria of machine games in which agents have a lexicographic disutility for complexity. First, because machines in equilibrium must minimize complexity, they have no unused Freeforon-screenuse;pleasedonotdistribute.Youcangetanotherfreecopy ofthisPDFororderthebookathttp://www.masfoundations.org. 158 6 RicherRepresentations:BeyondtheNormalandExtensiveForms states.

The news is not all bad; if we hold N fixed, then the problem does belong to P. We can explain this informally by noting that player i does not have to scan all of his possible strategies in order to decide whether automatonM is the best i response; since he knows the strategies of the other players, he merely needs to scantheactualpathtakenonthegametree,whichisboundedbythelengthofthe gametree. Notice that the previousresult held evenwhen the other playerswere assumed toplaypurestrategies.
