Lines 3 and 5 define the central components of the representation—the object grid_board thatrecordsallmarks, andthe flow ofthegame, whichis defined as two players alternating moves until either the board is full or one of the them wins the game. Lines 6–12 then provide the definitions of the terms used in line 5.

Ofparticularnoteisthattheformerprovided the main ideas behind the folk theorem and that the latter explored the theoreticaldifferencesbetweenfinitelyandinfinitelyrepeatedgames. Aumann’sworkon repeated games led to a Nobel Prize in 2005. Our proof of the folk theorem is based on Osborne and Rubinstein [1994]. For an extensive discussion of the Titfor-Tat strategy in repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma, and in particular this strategy’s strong performance in a tournament of computer programs, see Axelrod [1984]. Whilemostgametheorytextbookshavematerialonso-calledboundedrationality, the most comprehensive repository of results in the area was assembled by Rubinstein [1998]. Some of the specific references are as follows. Theorem 6.1.8 is due to Neyman [1985], while Theorem 6.1.9 is due to Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [1994]. Theorem 6.1.11 is due to Gilboa [1988], and Theorem 6.1.12 is duetoBen-Porath[1990]. Theorem6.1.13isduetoPapadimitriou[1992]. Finally, Theorems6.1.14and6.1.15areduetoNachbarandZame[1996]. Stochastic games were introduced in Shapley [1953]. The state of the art regardingthemcirca2003appearsintheeditedcollectionNeymanandSorin[2003]. Filar and Vrieze [1997] provide a rigorous introduction to the topic, integrating MDPs(orsingle-agentstochasticgames)andtwo-personstochasticgames. BayesiangameswereintroducedbyHarsanyi[1967–1968];in1994hereceived aNobelPrize,largelybecauseofthiswork. CongestiongameswerefirstdefinedbyRosenthal[1973];laterpotentialgames were introduced by Monderer and Shapley [1996a] and were shown to be equivalent to congestion games (up to isomorphism). The PLS-completeness result is duetoFabrikantetal. [2004]. NonatomiccongestiongamesareduetoSchmeidler [1973]. Selfishroutingwasfirststudiedasearlyas1920[Pigou,1920;Beckmann et al., 1956]. Pigou’s example comes from the former reference; Braess’ paradoxwasintroducedinBraess[1968].

The problem of finding pure Nash equilibria in graphical games was analyzed in Gottlob et al. [2003] and Daskalakis and Papadimitriou [2006].
