Theclashingvariabletoleaveis theoneinwhoseequationtheq/cratioissmallest. We illustrate the procedure on our example. Let us arbitrarily pick x′ as the 2 first entering variable. In this case we see immediately that s must leave, since 5 it is the only clashing variable. (x′ does not appear in the equation of any other 2 basisvariable.)Withx′ inthebasistheequationsmuchbeupdatedtoremoveany 2 occurrenceofx′ on the right-handside, whichin this caseis achievedsimply by 2 rearrangingthetermsofthesecondequationin(4.21).

This entails that s must leave (in this case 1 1 4 again,theonlyclashingvariable).

Renormalizing the vectors x′ and y′ to be proper probabilities, one gets the solution((2,1,0),(1, 2)) with payoffs4 and 2 to the 3 3 3 3 3 rowandcolumnplayers,respectively. PropertiesoftheLemke–Howsonalgorithm The Lemke–Howson algorithm has some good properties. First, it is guaranteed to find a sample Nash equilibrium.
