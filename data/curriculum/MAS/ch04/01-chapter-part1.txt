4 Computing Solution Concepts of Normal-Form Games The discussion of strategies and solution concepts in Chapter 3 largely ignored issuesofcomputation. Westartbyaskingthemostbasicquestion: Howhardisit tocomputetheNashequilibriaofagame? Theanswerturnsouttobequitesubtle, andtodependontheclassofgamesbeingconsidered. We have already seen how to compute the Nash equilibria of simple games. Thesecalculationsweredeceptivelyeasy,partlybecausetherewereonlytwoplayersandpartlybecauseeachplayerhadonlytwoactions. Inthischapterwediscuss several different classes of games, starting with the simple two-player, zero-sum normal-form game. Dropping only the zero-sum restriction yields a problem of differentcomplexity—whileitisgenerallybelievedthatanyalgorithmthatguaranteesasolutionmusthaveanexponentialworstcasecomplexity,itisalsobelieved thataprooftothis effectmaynotemergeforsometime.

TheNashequilibrium problem for such games can be expressed as a linear program (LP), which meansthatequilibriacanbecomputedinpolynomialtime.1 Consideratwo-player, zero-sumgameG = ( 1,2 ,A A ,(u ,u )). LetU∗ bethe expectedutility { } 1 × 2 1 2 i for player i in equilibrium (the value of the game); since the game is zero-sum, U∗ = U∗. The minmax theorem (see Section 3.4.1 and Theorem 3.4.4) tells 1 − 2 us thatU∗ holds constantin allequilibria andthatit is the sameas the valuethat 1 1.

Letusstartbylookingat 2 1 constraint(4.2). Thisstatesthatforeverypurestrategyj ofplayer1,hisexpected utility for playing any action j A given player 2’s mixed strategy s is at 1 2 ∈ most U∗. Those pure strategies for which the expected utility is exactly U∗ will 1 1 be in player 1’s best response set, while those pure strategies leading to lower expectedutilitywillnot. Ofcourse,asmentionedearlierU∗isavariable;thelinear 1 programwillchooseplayer2’smixedstrategyinordertominimizeU∗ subjectto 1 the constraint just discussed. Thus, lines (4.1) and (4.2) state that player 2 plays themixedstrategythatminimizestheutility player1cangainbyplayinghisbest response. Thisisalmostexactlywhatwewant. Allthatisleftistoensurethatthe values of the variables sk are consistent with their interpretation as probabilities. 2 Thus, the linear program also expresses the constraints that these variables must sumtoone(4.3)andmusteachbenonnegative(4.4). This linear program gives us player 2’s mixed strategy in equilibrium. In the samefashion,wecanconstructalinearprogramtogiveusplayer1’smixedstrategies. This program reverses the roles of player 1 and player 2 in the constraints; the objective is to maximize U∗, as player 1 wants to maximize his own payoffs. 1 Thiscorrespondstothedualofplayer2’sprogram. maximize U∗ (4.5) 1 subjectto u (aj,ak) sj U∗ k A (4.6) 1 1 2 · 1 ≥ 1 ∀ ∈ 2 j X ∈A1 sj = 1 (4.7) 1 j X ∈A1 sj 0 j A (4.8) 1 ≥ ∀ ∈ 1 Finally,wegiveaformulationequivalenttoourfirstlinearprogramfromEquations(4.1)–(4.4),whichwillbeusefulinthenextsection.
