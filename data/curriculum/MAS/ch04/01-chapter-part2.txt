Essentially, this is because the two players’ interests are no longer diametrically opposed. Thus, we cannot stateourproblemasanoptimizationproblem:oneplayerisnottryingtominimize theother’sutility. 4.2.1 ComplexityofcomputingasampleNashequilibrium The issue of characterizing the complexity of computing a sample Nash equilibriumistricky. Noknownreductionexistsfromourproblemtoadecisionproblem that is NP-complete, nor has our problem been shown to be easier. An intuitive stumbling block is that every game has at least one Nash equilibrium, whereas known NP-complete problems are expressiblein terms of decision problems that donotalwayshavesolutions. Current knowledge about the complexity of computing a sample Nash equilibriumthusreliesonanother,less familiarcomplexityclassthatdescribesthe probPPAD lem of finding a solution which always exists. This class is called PPAD, which stands for “polynomialparity argument, directed version.” To describe this class we must first define a family of directed graphs which we will denote (n). Let G eachgraphinthisfamilybedefinedonasetN of2n nodes. Althougheachgraph in (n) thus contains a numberof nodes that is exponentialin n, we want to reG strict ourattention to graphs that can be described in polynomialspace.

Of course, this proof is achievedby showing that the problem is in PPAD and thatanyotherprobleminPPADcanbereducedtoitinpolynomialtime. Toshow thattheproblemisinPPAD,areductionisgiven,whichexpressestheproblemof findingaNashequilibriumastheproblemoffindingsourceorsinknodesinagraph as described earlier. This reduction proceeds quite directly from the proof that every game has a Nash equilibrium that appeals to Sperner’s lemma. The harder part is the other half of the puzzle: showing that Nash equilibrium computation is PPAD-hard, or in other words that every problem in PPAD can be reduced to finding a Nash equilibrium of some game with size polynomialin the size of the original problem. This result, obtained in 2005, is a culmination of a series of intermediateresultsobtainedovermorethanadecade.
