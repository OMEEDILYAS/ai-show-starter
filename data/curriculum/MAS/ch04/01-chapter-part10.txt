This result follows straightforwardly from the observation that a game with k actionscanhave2k 1Nashequilibria,evenifthegameisnondegenerate(when − the game is degenerate, it can have an infinite number of equilibria). Consider a two-playerCoordination game in which both players have k actions and a utility function given by the identity matrix possesses 2k 1 Nash equilibria: one for − eachnonemptysubsetofthekactions.

While it does allow a formulation as a nonlinear nonlinearcomplementarityproblem,suchproblemsareoftenhopelesslyimpracticomplementarity caltosolveexactly. Unlikethetwo-playercase,therefore,itisunclearhowtobest problem formulate the problem as input to an algorithm. In this section we discuss three possibilities. Instead of solving the nonlinear complementarity problem exactly, there has been some success approximating the solution using a sequence of linear complementarityproblems(SLCP).EachLCPisanapproximationoftheproblem,and itssolutionisusedtocreatethenextapproximationinthesequence. Thismethod can be thought of as a generalization to Newton’s method of approximating the localmaximumofaquadraticequation.

Then,definedj(s)ascj(s)boundedfrombelowbyzero. i i cj(s)= u (aj,s ) u (s) i i i −i − i dj(s)= max(cj(s),0) i i Note that dj(s) is positive if and only if player i has an incentive to deviate to i actionaj. Thus, strategyprofile sis a Nashequilibriumifandonlyif dj(s) = 0 i i forallplayersi,andallactionsj foreachplayer.

Ofcourse,thispropertyholdseven if we did not square each dj(s), but doing so makes the function differentiable i everywhere. The constraints on the function are the obvious ones: each player’s distributionoveractionsmustsumtoone,andallprobabilitiesmustbenonnegative. The advantageofthis methodis its flexibility. We cannowapplyanymethodfor constrainedoptimization. If we instead want to use an unconstrained optimization method, we can roll theconstraintsintotheobjectivefunction(whichwenowcallg(s))insuchaway that we still have a differentiable function that is zero if and only if s is a Nash equilibrium.
