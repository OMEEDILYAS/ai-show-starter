First came the original definition of the class TFNP [Megiddo and Papadimitriou, 1991], a super-class of PPAD, followed by the definition of PPAD by Papadimitriou [1994]. Next, Goldberg and Papadimitriou [2006] showed that findinganequilibriumofagamewithanyconstantnumberofplayersisnoharder thanfindingtheequilibriumofafour-playergame,andDaskalakisetal. [2006b] showed that these computational problems are PPAD-complete. The result was almostimmediatelytightenedtoencompasstwo-playergamesbyChenandDeng [2006]. The NP-completenessresults for Nash equilibria with specific properties areduetoGilboaandZemel[1989]andConitzerandSandholm[2003b];theinapproximabilityresultappearedinConitzer[2006].

The graphical exposition of the Lemke–Howson algorithm appeared first in Shapley[1974], andthen in a modifiedversionin von Stengel[2002]. Ourdescription of the Lemke–Howson algorithm is based on the latter. An example of games for which all Lemke–Howson paths are of exponential length appears in SavaniandvonStengel[2004]. Scarf’s simplicial-subdivision-basedalgorithm is described in Scarf [1967]. Homotopy-basedapproximationmethods are covered, for example, in García and Zangwill [1981]. Govindan and Wilson’s homotopy method was presented in Govindan and Wilson [2003]; its path-following procedure depends on topological results due to Kohlberg and Mertens [1986]. The
