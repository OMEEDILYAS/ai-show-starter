The case of very weak dominance can be tested using essentially the same algorithm as in Figure 4.7, except that we must test the condition u (s ,s ) > i i −i u (s′,s ).

(We saw an example of this in Figure 3.16.) We cannot use a simple algorithm like the one in Figure 4.7 to test whether a given strategy s is dominated by a mixed strategy because these strategies cannot be i enumerated. However,itturnsoutthatwecanstillanswerthequestioninpolynomialtimebysolvingalinearprogram. Inthissection,wewillassumethatplayer i’s utilities are strictly positive. This assumption is without loss of generality becauseifanyplayeri’sutilitieswerenegative,wecouldaddaconstanttoallofi’s payoffswithoutchangingthegame(seeSection3.1.2). Each flavor of domination requires a somewhatdifferent linear program. First, letusconsiderstrictdominationbyamixedstrategy.

Because no constraints restrict the p ’s from above, this LP will always be feasible. However, in the opj timal solution the p ’s may not sum to 1; indeed, their sum can be greater than 1 j orlessthan1.
