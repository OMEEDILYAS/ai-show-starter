As we shall see, a closer lookatcommunicationaddstothecomplexityofthestory. Wecandistinguishbetweenpurely informationaltheoriesofcommunicationandmotivationalones. In informational communication, agents simply inform each other of different facts. The theories of belief change, introduced in Chapter 14, look at ways in which beliefs changein the face ofnew information—dependingon whetherthe beliefs are logical or probabilistic, consistent with prior beliefs or not. In this chapter we broaden the discussion and consider motivational theories of communication, involvingagentswithindividualmotivationsandpossiblecoursesofactions. We divide the discussion into three parts. The first concerns cheap talk and describes a situation in which self-motivated agents can engage in costless communicationbeforetakingaction. Aswesee,insomesituationsthistalkinfluences future behavior, and in some it does not. Cheap talk can be viewed as “doing by talking”;incontrast,signalinggamescanbeviewedas“talkingbydoing.” Insignalinggamesanagentcantakeactionsthat,byvirtueoftheunderlyingincentives, communicatetotheotheragentsomethingnew.

Intuitively, the answeris no. Regardlessofthe otheragent’saction, thegivenagent’sbestactionisstill D;theotheragent’stalkisindeedcheap. Furthermore, regardlessof his true intention, it is the interest of a given agentto get the other agentto play C; his talk is not only cheap, but also not credible (or, as thesayinggoes,thetalkisfree—andwortheverypenny).

It must be mentioned that the precise analysis of this example, as well as the laterexamples, is subtle in a numberofways. In particular, the equilibriumanalysis reveals other, less desirable equilibria than the ones in which a meaningful messageis transmitted and received.

Insuchgamestheutterfocalpoint ance creates a so-called focal point, a signal on which the agents can coordinate their actions. But now consider the well-known Stag Hunt game, whose payoff StagHuntgame matrixisshowninFigure8.3. Inthestorybehindthisgame,ArtemisandCalliope are about to go hunting, and are trying to decide whether they want to hunt stag or hare. If both hunt stag, they do very well; if one tries to hunt stag alone, she fails completely.
