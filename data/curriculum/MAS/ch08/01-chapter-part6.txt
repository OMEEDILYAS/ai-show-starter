First, you should persuade yourself that these are in fact Nash equilibria (and evensubgame-perfectones,or,tobemoreprecisesincethisisagameofimperfect information, sequential equilibria). But then we might ask, is there a reason to preferoneovertheother? Well,onewaytoselectisbasedontheexpectedpayoff to the players. After all, this is a cooperativegame, and it makes sense to expect the players to coordinateon the equilibrium with the highestpayoff. Indeed, this wouldbeonewaytoimplementGrice’scooperativeprinciple. Notethatinthefirst equilibriumthe(common)payoffis7,whileinthesecondequilibriumtheexpected payoffis0.99 10+0.01 7 = 9.97.

We give a brief descriptionofsomeoftheseapplicationsbelow. Intelligentdialogsystems dialogsystem One obvious application of speech act theory is a dialog system, which communicateswith humanusersthrougha naturallanguagedialog interface. In orderto communicateefficientlyandnaturallywiththeuser,dialogsystemsmustobeythe principlesofhumanconversation,includingthosefromAustinandGricepresented inthischapter. TRAINS/TRIPS is a well-known dialog system, and is to assist the user in accomplishing tasks in a transportation domain. The system has access to information about the state of the transportation network, and the user makes decisions about what actions to take. The system maintains an ongoing conversation with theuseraboutpossibleactionsandthestateofthenetwork.
