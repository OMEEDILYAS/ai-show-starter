In this case the implicature may be clear from the contextof their conversation, or A may have to ask B what he means.

Let us begin withanexample. Aisstandingbyanimmobilizedcar,andisapproachedbyB. A says,“Iamoutofgas.”Bsays,“Thereisagaragearoundthecorner.” AlthoughB doesnotexplicitlysayit,sheimplicateseffectivelythatshethinksthatthegarage is openandsells gasoline. This follows immediatelyfrom the assumptionthatB isfollowingtheGriceanmaximsofrelationandquality. Ifshewerenotfollowing the maxim of relation, her utterance about the garage could be a non sequitur; if she were not following the maxim of quality, she could be lying. In order for a conversational implicature to occur, (1) the hearer must assume that the speaker isfollowingthemaxims,(2)thisassumptionisnecessaryforthehearertogetthe impliedmeaning,and(3)itiscommonknowledgethatthehearercanworkoutthe implication. Griceoffersthreetypesofconversationalimplicature. In thefirst, nomaximis violated, as in the aforementioned example. In the second, a maxim is violated, butthehearerassumesthattheviolationisbecauseofaclashwithanothermaxim. For example, if A asks, “Where does C live?” and B responds, “Somewhere in theSouthofFrance,”AcanpresumethatB doesnotknowmoreandthusviolates themaximofquantityin ordertoobeythemaximofquality. Finally, in thethird typeofconversationalimplicature,amaximisflouted,andthehearerassumesthat there must be another reason for it. For example, when a recommendationletter says very little about the candidate in question, the maxim of quantity is flouted, andthereadercansafelyassumethatthereisverylittlepositivetosay. We give some examples of commonly-occurring conversational implicatures. Humans often use an if statement to implicate an if and only if statement. Suppose A says to B, “If you teach me speech acttheory I’ll kiss you.” In this case, if A did not mean if and only if, then A might kiss B whether or not B teaches A speech act theory. Then A would have been violating the maxim of quantity, tellingtheB somethingthatdidnotcontainanyusefulinformation.

This reflects the nature of the work in the field. There are advantages to the relative laxness; it enables a very broad and multifaceted theory.
