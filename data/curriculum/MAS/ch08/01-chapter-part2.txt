answeris arguably yes. Considerthe message“Iplan to huntstag.” It is not self-revealing; Artemis would like Calliope to believe this, even if she does not actuallyplantohuntstag. However,itisself-committing;ifArtemisweretothink thatCalliopebelievesher,thenArtemis wouldactuallypreferto huntstag. There ishoweverthequestionofwhetherCalliopewouldbelievetheutterance,knowing thatitisnotself-revealingonthepartofArtemis. Forthisreason,someviewself-commitmentwithoutself-revelationasanotion lacking force. To gainfurther insightinto this issue, let us define the Stag Hunt game more generally.

Theactualgamebeing played is determined by Nature; for concreteness, let us assume that selection is done with uniform probability.

But sometimes actions speak louder than words. In this section we consider a class of imperfect-informationgamescalledsignalinggames. signalinggame Definition8.2.1(Signalinggame) Asignalinggameisatwo-playergameinwhich Nature selects a game to be played accordingto a commonly known distribution, player 1 is informed of that choice and chooses an action, and player 2 then choosesanactionwithoutknowingNature’schoice,butknowingplayer1’schoice. In other words, a signaling game is an extensive-form game in which player 2 hasincompleteinformation. It is tempting to model player 2’s decision problem as follows. Since each of the possible gameshas a differentset of payoffs, player2 mustfirst calculatethe posteriorprobabilitydistributionoverpossiblegames,giventhe messagethatshe received from player 1. She can calculate this using Bayes rule with the prior distribution over games and the conditional probabilities of player 1’s message giventhegame.

But moreacutely, how doesplayer2 calculate the probability of player 1’s message given a certain game? This is not at all obviousin light of the fact that player2 knows that player1 knows that player2 willgothroughsuchreasoning,etcetera. Indeed,evenifplayer1hasadominant strategyinthegamebeingplayedthesituationisnotstraightforward. Considerthe following signaling game.
