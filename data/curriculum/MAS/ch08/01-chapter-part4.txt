As mentioned at the very start of the chapter, human communicationis analyzedonmanydifferentlevelsofabstraction,amongthemthesyntactic,semantic, and pragmatic levels. The discussion of speech acts lies squarely within the pragmatic level, although it should be noted that there are legitimate arguments againstacrispseparationamongtheselayers. 8.3.1 Speechacts The traditional view of communication is that it is the sharing of information. Speech-act theory, due to the philosopher J. L. Austin, embodies the insight that somecommunicationscaninsteadbeviewedasactions,intendedtoachievesome goal.
