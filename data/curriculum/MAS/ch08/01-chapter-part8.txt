We will focuson the partofthe literature thatbears mostdirectlyonthematerialpresentedinthechapter. Two early seminal discussions on cheap talk are due to Crawford and Sobel [1982]andFarrell[1987].LaterreferencesincludeRabin[1990]andFarrell[1993]. GoodoverviewsaregivenbyFarrell[1995]andFarrellandRabin[1996]. The literature on signaling games dates considerably farther back. The Stackelberg leadership model, later couched in game-theoretic terminology (as we do in the book), was introduced by Heinrich von Stackelberg, a German economist, as a model of duopoly in economics [von Stackelberg, 1934]. The literature on informationeconomics,andinparticularonasymmetricinformation,continuedto Freeforon-screenuse;pleasedonotdistribute.Youcangetanotherfreecopy ofthisPDFororderthebookathttp://www.masfoundations.org. 252 8 Communication flourish,culminatinginthe2001NobelPrizeawardedtothreepioneersinthearea (Akerlof,Spence,andStiglitz).
