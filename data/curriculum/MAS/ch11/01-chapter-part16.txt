Regardlessofhowwechoosetoclassifythem,positionauctionsareveryimportant. Fromatheoreticalpointofviewtheyareinterestingandhavegoodproperties both in terms of incentives and computation. Practically speaking, major search enginesusethemto sellmanybillionsofdollarsworthofadvertisingspaceannually, and indeed did so evenbefore much was known aboutthe auctions’theoretical properties. In these auctions, search engines offer a set of keyword-specific “slots”—usuallya list on the right-handside ofa page ofsearchresults—forsale to interestedadvertisers. Slots are consideredto bemore valuablethe closerthey aretothetopofthepage,becausethisaffectstheirlikelihoodofbeingclickedby a user. Advertisers place bids on keywords of interest, which are retained by the system. Every time a usersearches for a keywordon which advertisers have bid, anauctionisheld. Theoutcomeofthisauctionisadecisionaboutwhichadswill appearon the searchresults pageand in which order. Advertisersare requiredto pay only if a user clicks on their ad. Because sponsored search is the dominant applicationofpositionauctions,wewilluseitasourmotivatingexamplehere. How should position auctions be modeled? The setting can be understood as inducinganinfinitelyrepeatedBayesiangame,becauseanewauctionisheldevery time a usersearchesfor a givenkeyword. However,researchershave arguedthat it makes sense to study an unrepeated, perfect-information model of the setting. The single-shot assumption is considered reasonable because advertisers tend to valueclicksadditively(i.e., thevaluederivedfromagivenuserclickingonanad Freeforon-screenuse;pleasedonotdistribute.Youcangetanotherfreecopy ofthisPDFororderthebookathttp://www.masfoundations.org. 360 11 ProtocolsforMultiagentResourceAllocation:Auctions is independentofhowmanyotherusersclickedearlier), atleastwhenadvertisers do not face budget constraints. The perfect-information assumption makes sense becausesearchenginesallowbidderseithertoobserveotherbidsortofigurethem outbyprobingthemechanism. Wenowgiveaformalmodel.Asbefore,letN bethesetofbidders(advertisers), and let v be i’s (commonly known) valuation for getting a click. Let b R i i + ∈ denote i’s bid, and let b denote the jth-highest bid, or 0 if there are fewer than (j) j bids. Let G = 1,...,m denote the set of goods (slots), and let α denote j { } click-through theexpectednumberofclicks(theclick-throughrate)thatanadwillreceiveifitis rate listedintheithslot. Observethatweassumethatαdoesnotdependonthebidder’s identity. The generalized first-price auction was the first position auction to be used by searchenginecompanies.
