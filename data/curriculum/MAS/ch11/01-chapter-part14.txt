Ofcourse,thisresultholdsonlyifwebelieve that bidders are correctly described by the theorem’s assumptions (e.g., they are risk neutral) and that they will play equilibrium strategies. The fact that auction houses like eBay opt for non-dominant-strategy mechanisms suggests that these beliefsmaynotalwaysbereasonableinpractice. We can also use this revenue equivalence result to analyze another setting: resequential peatedsingle-goodauctionmechanisms,orso-calledsequentialauctions.

Asthenumberoffutureroundsdecreases,so does this expected utility; hence in equilibrium bids rise.) We can therefore concludethattheauctionisefficient, andthusbyTheorem11.2.1eachbiddermakes the same expected payment as under VCG. Thus there exists a symmetric equilibrium in which bidders bid honestly in the final auction k, and in each auction j < k,eachbidderibidstheexpectedvalueofthekth-highestoftheotherbidders’ valuations, conditional on the assumption that his valuation v lies between the i jth-highestand the j +1st-highest valuations. This makes sense becausein each auctionthebidderwhoiscorrectinmakingthisassumptionwillbethebidderwho placesthesecond-highestbidandsetsthepriceforthewinner.

Verysimilar reasoningcanbeusedto showthata symmetricequilibriumfor k sequential first-price auctions is for each bidder i in each auction j k to bid ≤ the expectedvalueof the kth-highestof the otherbidders’valuations, conditional on the assumption that his valuation v lies between the j 1st-highest and the i − jth-highestvaluations.

Representingmultiunitvaluations We have assumed that agents can communicate their complete valuations to the auctioneer. When a large numberof units are available in an auction, this means that bidders must specify a valuation for every numberof units.
