Heuristicmethods In many cases the solutions to the associated linear program will not be integral. In these cases we must resort to using heuristic methods to find solutions to the auctionproblem. Heuristic methods come in two broad varieties. The first is complete heuristic methods, which are guaranteed to find an optimal solution if one exists. Despite their discouraging worst-case guarantees, in practice complete heuristic methods are able to solve many interesting problems within reasonable amounts of time. This makes such algorithms the tool of choice for many practical combinatorial auctions. One drawback is that it can be difficult to anticipate how long such algorithms will require to solve novel problem instances, as in the end their performancedependson a problem instance’scombinatorialstructure ratherthan on easily-measured parameters like the number of goods or bids. Complete heuristicalgorithmstendto performtreesearch(toguaranteecompleteness)alongwith somesortofpruningtechniquetoreducetheamountofsearchrequired(theheuristic). The second flavor of heuristic algorithm is incomplete methods, which are not guaranteedtofindoptimalsolutions. Indeed,aswasmentionedearlier,ingeneral there does not even exist a tractable algorithm that can guarantee that you will reachanapproximatesolutionthatiswithinafixedfractionoftheoptimalsolution, no matter how small the fraction. However, methods do exist that can guarantee a solution that is within 1/√k of the optimal solution, where k is the numberof Freeforon-screenuse;pleasedonotdistribute.Youcangetanotherfreecopy ofthisPDFororderthebookathttp://www.masfoundations.org. 368 11 ProtocolsforMultiagentResourceAllocation:Auctions goods. More importantly, like their complete cousins, incomplete heuristic algorithms often perform very well in practice despite these theoretical caveats.

We already discussed multiunit valuations in Section 11.2.3 (additive; single item; fixedbudget;majority; general).
