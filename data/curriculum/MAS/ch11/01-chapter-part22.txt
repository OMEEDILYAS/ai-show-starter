Corollary11.3.10 Any valuation that can be represented by XOR-of-OR bids of size s can also be represented by OR* bids of size s, using at most s2 dummy items. Let us briefly review the properties of the languages we have discussed. The XOR, OR-of-XORs, XOR-of-OR and OR* languagesare all powerfulenoughto express all valuations. Second, the efficiencies of the OR-of-XOR and XOR-ofOR languages are incomparable: there are bids that can be expressed succinctly inonebutnottheother,andvice-versa. Third, theOR*languageis strictly more compactthan both the OR-of-XORand XOR-of-OR languages: it can efficiently simulate both languages, and can succinctlyexpress some valuations that require exponentialsizeineachofthem.

One might ask why we even consider bidding languagesthat have exponential interpretation complexity. Simply stated, the answer is that languages with only polynomialinterpretationcomplexityareeithernotexpressiveenoughornotcompact enough. This brings us to a more relaxed criterion. It may be sufficient to require that a given claim about a bid’s valuation for a set is verifiable in polyverification nomial time. We define the verification complexity of a bidding language as the complexity minimum time required to verify the valuation v(S), given input of an arbitrary UncorrectedmanuscriptofMultiagentSystems,publishedbyCambridgeUniversityPress Revision1.1©Shoham&Leyton-Brown,2009,2010. 11.3 Combinatorialauctions 373 subsetS G,anarbitrarybidvinthelanguage,andaproofoftheproposedvalu- ⊆ ationv(S). Allofthelanguageswehavepresentedinthissectionhavepolynomial verificationcomplexity. 11.3.4 Iterative mechanisms We haveargued that in a combinatorialauctionsetting, agents’valuations can be socomplexthattheycannotbetractablycommunicated. Theideabehindbidding languages(Section11.3.3)isthatthiscommunicationlimitationcanbeovercome if an agent’s valuation can be succinctly represented. In this section we consider another,somewhatindependentidea: replacingthesealed-bidmechanismwehave discussedsofarwithanindirectmechanismthatprobesagents’valuationsonlyas necessary. Intuitively, the use of indirectmechanismsin combinatorialauctionsoffers the possibility of several benefits. Most fundamentally, allowing the mechanism to query bidders selectively can reduce communication. For example, if the mechanismarrivedatthedesiredoutcome(saytheVCGallocationandpayments)aftera smallnumberofqueries,otheragentscouldrealizethattheywereunabletomake a bid that would improve the allocation, and could thus quit the auction without communicatinganymore information to the auctioneer. This sort ofreductionin communicationis still usefulevenif the auction is smallenoughthatagents’full valuationscouldbetractablyconveyed.First,reducingcommunicationcanbenefit bidderswhowanttorevealaslittleaspossibleabouttheirvaluationstotheircompetitors and/or to the auctioneer. Second, iterative mechanisms can help in cases where it is difficult for bidders to determine their own valuations. For example, in a logistics domain a bidder might have to solve a traveling salesman problem todeterminehisvaluationforagivenbundleandthuscouldfaceacomputational barriertodetermininghiswholevaluationfunction. Indirectmechanismsalsohavebenefitsthatgobeyondreducingcommunication. First,theycanbeeasierforbidderstounderstandthancomplexdirectmechanisms like VCG, and so can be seen as more transparent. This matters, for example, in governmentauctionsofpublicassetslikeradiospectrum,wheretaxpayerswantto be assured that the auction was conductedfairly. Finally,
