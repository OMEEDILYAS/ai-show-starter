What is the lowest acceptable next bid? Intuitively,itdependsonthequantity—abidfor3unitsat$2/unitcanbesatisfied, buta bidfor7 units at$2/unitcannot.

Thus,insteadofasecond-priceauctionwehaveak+1st-priceauction. One immediate observationthat we can make aboutthis auction mechanism is that a seller will notnecessarily achievehigherprofits by selling more units. For example,considerthevaluationsinTable11.2.

In this auction bidders are charged the lowest winning bid rather than the highest losing bid.9 This has the advantage that winning bidders always pay a nonzero amount, even when there are fewer bids than there are units for sale. In essence, this makes the bidders’ strategic problem somewhat harder (the lowest winningbidderisabletoimprovehisutilitybybiddingdishonestly,andsooverall, bidders no longer have dominant strategies) in exchange for making the seller’s strategicproblemsomewhateasier.
