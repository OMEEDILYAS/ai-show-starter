Althoughthisisasevererestrictiononagents’valuations, it does not make the winner determinationproblem anyeasier. Intuitively, this is becauseagentsremainfreetochooseanybundlesfromthesetofpossiblebundles 2G,andsotheauctioneercanreceivebidsonanysetofbundles. In a direct mechanism for single-minded bidders, every bidder i places a bid b = (s ,v ) indicating a bundle of interest s and an amount v . (Observe that i i i i i we have assumed that the auctioneer does not know bidder i’s bundle of interest s ; this is why i’s bid must have two parts.)

We leave the proofof this theorem as an exercise; however,it is not hard. Observe that, because it is based on a greedy algorithm, this mechanism does not selectan efficientallocation.
