However,theydifferfromtheotherexampleswegave,suchasnewcars,in animportantway. This differenceis thata sellerofMP3 downloadscanproduce additional units of the good at zero marginal cost, and hence has an effectively unlimitedsupplyofthe good. This doesnotmeanthatthe units haveno valueor thatthesellershouldgivethemaway—afterall,thefirstunitmaybeveryexpensive toproduce,requiringthesellertoamortizethiscostacrossthesaleofmultipleunits. Whatitdoesmeanisthatthesellerwillnotfaceanysupplyrestrictionsotherthan thosesheimposesherself. We thus face the following multiunit auction problem: how should a seller choose a multiunit auction mechanism for use in an unlimited supply setting if she cares about maximizing her revenue? The goal will be finding an auction mechanismthatchoosesamongbidsinawaythatachievesgoodrevenuewithout artificiallypickingaspecificnumberofgoodstosellinadvance,andalsowithout relying on distributional information about buyers’ valuations. We also want the mechanismtobedominant-strategytruthful,individuallyrational,andweaklybudget balanced. Clearly, it will be necessary to artificially restrict supply (and thus causeallocativeinefficiency),becauseotherwisebidderswouldbeabletowinunits ofthegoodinexchangeforarbitrarilysmallpayments. Althoughthisassumption canberelaxed,tosimplifythepresentationwewillreturntoourpreviousassumptionthatbiddersareinterestedinbuyingatmostoneunitofthegood. The main insight that allows us to construct a mechanism for this case is that, if we knewbidders’ valuations but had to offer the goods at the same price to all bidders,itwouldbeeasytocomputetheoptimalsingleprice. optimalsingle Definition11.2.3(Optimalsingleprice) Theoptimalsinglepriceiscalculatedas price follows. 1.

However, this procedure can be used as a building block to construct a simpleandpowerfuldominant-strategytruthfulmechanism. Definition11.2.4(Randomsamplingoptimalpriceauction) Therandomsampling random optimalpriceauctionisdefinedasfollows. sampling 1. Randomly partition the set of biddersN into two sets, N and N (i.e., N = optimalprice 1 2 auction N 1 N 2 ;N 1 N 2 = ;eachbidderhasprobability0.5ofbeingassignedto ∪ ∩ ∅ eachset). 2.
