began this discussion by introducing a new assumption: that different bidders’valuationscouldbedrawnfromdifferentdistributions. Whathappenswhen thisdoesnotoccur,andinsteadallbidders’valuationscomefromthesamedistribution? In this case, the optimalauctionhas a simplerinterpretation: it is simply a second-price auction (without virtual valuations) in which the seller sets a reserve price r∗ at the value that satisfies r∗ 1−Fi(r∗) = 0. For this reason, it − fi(r∗) is common to hear the claim that optimal auctions correspond to setting reserve pricesoptimally. Itisimportanttorecognizethatthisclaimholdsonlyinthecase of symmetric IPV valuations. In the asymmetric case, the virtual valuations can beunderstoodas artificially increasingthe amountofweakbidders’bids in order to make them more competitive. This sacrifices efficiency, but more than makes upforitonexpectationbyforcingbidderswith higherexpectedvaluationsto bid moreaggressively. Althoughoptimalauctionsareinterestingfromatheoreticalpointofview,they detail-free are rarely to never used in practice. The problem is that they are not detail free: auction theyrequirethesellertoincorporateinformationaboutthebidders’valuationdistributions into the mechanism. Such auctions are often considered impractical; Wilsondoctrine famously,theWilsondoctrineurgesauctiondesignerstoconsideronlydetailfree mechanisms.Withthiscriticisminmind,itisinterestingtoaskthefollowingquestion. In a symmetric IPV setting, is it better for the auctioneer to set an optimal reserveprice(causingtheauctiontodependonthebidders’valuationdistribution) or to attract one additional bidder to the auction? Interestingly, the auctioneer is betteroffinthelattercase. Intuitively,anextrabidderissimilartoareserveprice inthesensethathisadditiontotheauctionincreasescompetitionamongtheother bidders, butdiffers becausehe can also buy the good himself.

Such cooperation between bidders is called collusion. Collusion is usually illegal; interestingly, however, it is also notoriouslydifficult for agents to pull off. The reason is conceptuallysimilar to the situation faced by agents playing the Prisoner’s Dilemma (see Section 3.4.3): while a given agent is better off if everyone cooperates than if everyone behaves selfishly, he is even better off if everyoneelsecooperatesandhebehavesselfishlyhimself. Aninterestingquestion to ask about collusion, therefore, is which collusive protocols have the property thatagentswill gainbycolludingwhile beingunableto gainfurtherbydeviating fromtheprotocol.

First of all, consider the case where k = 0. Here it is easy to see that this protocol is strategicallyequivalentto a second-priceauctionin a world wherethe bidder’s cartel does not exist. The high bidderalways wins, and always pays the globally second-highestprice(themaxofthesecond-highestpricesinthecartelandinthe mainauction).
