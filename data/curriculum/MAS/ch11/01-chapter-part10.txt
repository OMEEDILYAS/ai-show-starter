The second condition of the revenueequivalence theorem states that a bidder with the lowest possible valuation must receive zero expected utility. This condition is violated under our bidding ring protocol,inwhichsuchanagenthasanexpectedutilityofk. First-priceauctions Theconstructionofbiddingringprotocolsismuchmoredifficultinthefirst-price auction setting. This is for a number of reasons. First, in order to make a lower expectedpayment, the winnermust actually place a lower bid.

Thisdifferencematters becausein thesecond-priceauctionthesecond-highestbidderhasnoincentiveto renegeon his offerto drop outofthe auction; by doingso, he can only makethe winnerpaymore. In the first-price auction, the second-highestbiddercouldtrick the highestbidderinto biddinglowerby offeringto dropout, andthen couldstill win the good at less than his valuation.
