Indeed, areaderfamiliarwithalgorithmsandcomplexitymayrecognizethecombinatorial setpacking auction allocation problem as a set packing problem (SPP). Unfortunately, it is problem well known that the SPP is NP-complete. This means that it is not likely that a polynomial-time algorithm exists for the problem. Worse, it so happens this problemcannotevenbeapproximateduniformly,meaningthattheredoesnotexist apolynomial-timealgorithmandafixedconstantk > 0suchthatforallinputsthe algorithmreturnsasolutionthatisatleast 1s∗,wheres∗isthevalueoftheoptimal k solutionforthegiveninput. Therearetwoprimaryapproachestogettingaroundthecomputationalproblem. First, we can restrict ourselves to a special class of problems for which there is guaranteedtoexistapolynomial-timesolution. Second,wecanresorttoheuristic methods that give up the guarantee of polynomialrunning time, optimality of sorelaxation lution, or both. In both cases, relaxation methods are a common approach. One method instance of the first approach is to relax the integrality constraint, thereby transforming the problem into a linear program, which is solvable by known methods in polynomial time. In general the solution results in “fractional” allocations, in which fractions of goods are allocated to differentbidders. If we are lucky, however,oursolutiontotheLPwilljusthappentobeintegral. 11.
