while no generalresult showsthis formally, experiencewith single-goodauctionsin the commonand affiliated values case (Section 11.1.10) suggests that allowing bidders to iteratively exchangepartial information abouttheir valuations may lead to improvementsin bothrevenueandefficiency. Ofcourse,consideringiterativemechanismsalso invitesnewchallenges. Most ofall, suchmechanismsaretremendouslycomplicated,andhencecanrequireextensive effortto design. Furthermore, small flaws in this design can lead to huge problems.

For example, agents can bid insincerely inordertosignaleachother(e.g.,“donotbidonmybundleandIwillnotbidon yours”), and thus collude against the seller. Another problem is that agents can oftengainbywaitingforotherstorevealinformation,especiallyinsettingswhere determiningone’sownvaluationiscostly.

Becauseiterativemechanismscanbecomequitecomplex,wewillnotformally describe any of them here. (As always, interested readers should consult the referencescited at the endof the chapter.) However,we will notesome ofthe main questions addressed in this literature, and some of the general trends in the answers to these questions. The first questionis whatsocialchoicefunctionsto implement, and thus what payments to impose. Here a popular choice is to design mechanisms that converge to an efficient allocation, and that elicit enough informationtoguaranteethatagentspaythesameamountsthattheywouldunderVCG. Even if an indirect mechanism mimics VCG, it does not automatically inherit its equilibriumproperties—therevelationprincipleonlycoversthetransformationof indirectmechanisms into direct mechanisms. Indeed, underindirect mechanisms thatmimicVCG,answeringquerieshonestlyisnolongeradominantstrategy. For example,ifagentiknowsthatagentjwilloverbid,agentimayalsowanttodoso, asdishonestdeclarationsbyj canaffectthequeriesthatiwillreceiveinthefuture.

A secondquestionis whatsorts ofqueriesthe indirectmechanismsshouldask. valuequery The mostpopularare probablyvalue queriesanddemandqueries. A mechanism asks a value query when it suggests a bundle and asks how much it is worth to a demandquery bidder.

Of course, all sorts of otherquery families are also possible. auction For example, bidders can be asked order queries (state which of two bundles is preferred)andboundingqueries(answerwhetheragivenbundleisworthmoreor orderquery less than a given amount). Some mechanisms even allow push-pull queries: bidboundingquery derscananswerquestionstheyweren’tasked,andcandeclinetoanswerquestions theywereasked. The final general lesson to convey from the literature on iterative combinatorial auctions is that in the worst case, any mechanism that achieves an efficient or approximately efficient12 allocation in equilibrium must receive an amount of information equal in size to a single agent’s complete valuation. Since the size of an agent’s valuation is exponential in the number of goods, this is discouraging. However, this result speaks only about the worst case and only about bidderswithunrestrictedvaluations.Researchershavemanagedtoshowtheoretically thatworst-casecommunicationrequirementsarepolynomialundersomerestricted classes of valuations or when the querycomplexity
