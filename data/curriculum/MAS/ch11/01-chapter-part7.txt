A similar dynamic holds if the bidders are all risk neutral, but the seller is either risk averse or risk seeking. The variations in bidders’ payments are greater in second-price auctions than they are in first-price auctions, because the former dependsonthetwo highestdrawsfrom thevaluationdistribution, whilethelatter dependsononlythehighestdraw.

Second,we discuss the effect of entry costs on equilibrium strategies. Finally, we consider auctionswithuncertainnumbersofbidders. Reverseauctions Sofar,wehaveconsideredauctionsinwhichthereisonesellerandasetofbuyers. Whatabouttheopposite: anenvironmentinwhichthereisonebuyerandasetof requestforquote sellers? This is what occurs when a buyer engages in a request for quote (RFQ). Broadly, this is called a reverse auction, because in its open-outcry variety this reverseauction scenarioinvolvespricesthatdescendratherthanascending. It turns out that everything that we have said about auctions also applies to reverse auctions. Reverse auctions are simply auctions in which we substitute the word “seller” for “buyer” and vice versa and furthermore, negate all numbers indicating prices or bid amounts. Because of this equivalence we will not discuss reverseauctionsanyfurther;note,however,thatourconcentrationon(nonreverse) auctionsiswithoutlossofgenerality.

This is the introduction of an entry cost to an auction. Imagine that a firstpriceauctioncost$1toattend. Howshouldbiddersdecidewhetherornottoattend, andthenhowshouldtheydecidetobidgiventhatthey’renolongersurehowmany other bidders will have chosen to attend? This is a realistic way of augmenting ourauctionmodel: forexample,itcanbeusedtomodelthecostofresearchingan auction,driving(ornavigatingaWebbrowser)toit, andspendingthetimetobid. However,itcanmakeequilibriumanalysismuchmorecomplex. Things are straightforward for second-price (or, for IPV valuations, Japanese and English) auctions. To decide whether to participate, bidders must evaluate theirexpectedgainfromparticipation. Thismeansthattheequilibriumstrategyin theseauctionsnowdoesdependonthedistributionofotheragents’valuationsand onthe numberofthese agents. The goodnewsis that, oncetheyhave decidedto bid,itremainsanequilibriumforbidderstobidtruthfully. Infirst-priceauctions(and,generally,otherauctionsthatdonothaveadominantstrategy equilibrium) auctions with entry costs are harder—though certainly not impossible—to analyze. Again, bidders must make a trade-off between their expected gain from participating in the auction and the cost of doing so. The complicationhereis that, sinceheis uncertainaboutotheragents’valuations,a given bidderwillthusalsobeuncertainaboutthenumberofagentswhowilldecidethat participatingintheauctionisintheirinterest. Sinceanagent’sequilibriumstrategy giventhathehaschosentoparticipatedependsonthe numberofotherparticipatingagents,thismakesthatequilibriumstrategymorecomplicatedtocompute.And that, in turn, makes it more difficult to determine the agent’s expected gain from participatinginthefirstplace. Auctionswithuncertainnumbersofbidders Our standardmodelof auctions has presumedthat the numberof bidders is commonknowledge. However,itmaybethecasethatbiddersareuncertainaboutthe number of competitors they face, especially in a sealed-bid auction or in an auction held overthe internet. The preceding discussion of entry costs gave another exampleof how this could occur. Thus, it is naturalto elaborate ourmodelto allowforthepossibilitythatbiddersmightbeuncertainaboutthenumberofagents participatingintheauction. It turns outthat modelingthis scenariois not as straightforwardas it mightappear. In particular, one must be carefulaboutthe fact that bidderswill be able to updatetheirexantebeliefsaboutthetotalnumberofparticipantsbyconditioning on the fact of their own selection, and thus may lead to a situation in which bidders’ beliefs about the number of participants may be asymmetric. (This can be especiallydifficultwhenthemodeldoesnotplaceanupperboundonthenumber ofagents who can participate in an auction.) We
