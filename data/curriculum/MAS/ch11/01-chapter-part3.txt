Unless we indicate otherwise, we will commonly assumeriskneutrality. We are left with the task of describingthe agents’valuations: theirutilities for different allocations of the goods x X. Auction theory distinguishes between ∈ a numberof different settings here. One of the best-known and most extensively independent studied is the independent private value (IPV) setting. In this setting all agents’ privatevalue valuationsaredrawnindependentlyfromthesame(commonlyknown)distribution, (IPV) andanagent’stype(or“signal”)consistsonlyofhisownvaluation,givinghimno informationaboutthevaluationsoftheothers. AnexamplewheretheIPVsetting is appropriate is in auctions consisting of bidders with personal tastes who aim to buy a piece of art purely for their own enjoyment. In most of this section we willassumethatagentshaveindependentprivatevalues,thoughwewillexplorean alternative,thecommon-valueassumption,inSection11.1.10. 11.1.3 Second-price,Japanese,andEnglishauctions Letusnowconsiderwhetherthesecond-pricesealed-bidauction,whichisadirect mechanism,istruthful(i.e.,whetheritprovidesincentivefortheagentstobidtheir truevalues).

The second-price auction is a special case of the VCG mechanism, and hence of the Groves mechanism. Thus, Theorem 11.1.1 follows directly from Theorem10.4.2.

Now considerthe other case, where i’s valuation is less than at least one other bidder’s bid. In this case i would lose and pay zero (Figure 11.1e).
