Observethatthe statedequilibriumstrategyis differentfromthestrategygiven above for second-price auctions: thus, while second-price and Japanese auctions are strategically equivalentin the IPV case, this equivalencedoes nothold in CV domains. Affiliatedvaluesandrevenuecomparisons The common value modelis generalizedby anothervaluation modelcalled affiliaffiliatedvalues atedvalues,whichpermitscorrelationsbetweenbidders’signals.Forexample,this lattermodelcandescribecaseswhereabidder’svaluationisdividedintoaprivatevalue component (e.g., the bidder’s inherent value for the good) and a commonvalue component (e.g., the bidder’s private, noisy signal about the good’s resale value).

Second, this argument leads to a powerful result known as the linkage princilinkageprinciple ple. If the seller has access to any private source of information that she knows is affiliated with the bidders’valuations,she is better offprecommittingto reveal it honestly. Consider the example of an auction of used cars, where the quality ofeachcaris a randomvariableaboutwhichthe seller, andeachbidder,receives someinformation.

Inpracticetherewilloftenbemorethanonegoodtoallocate,anddifferent multiunit goodsmayendupgoingtodifferentbidders. Hereweconsidermultiunitauctions, auctions in whichthereis still onlyonekind ofgoodavailable,butthere arenowmultiple identicalcopies ofthat good. (Think of new cars, tickets to a movie, MP3 downloads, or shares of stock in the same company.) Although this setting seems like only a small step beyond the single-item case we considered earlier, it turns out thatthereisstillalottobesaidaboutit. 11.2.1 Canonicalauctionfamilies InSection11.1.1wesurveyedsomecanonicalsingle-goodauctionfamilies. Here wereviewthesameauctions,explaininghoweachcanbeextendedtothemultiunit case. Sealed-bidauctions Overall,sealed-bidauctionsinmultiunitsettingsdifferfromtheirsingle-unitcousins inseveralways. First,considerpaymentrules. Iftherearethreeitemsforsale,and eachofthe top three bids requestsa single unit, then eachbid will win onegood. Ingeneral,thesebidswillofferdifferentamounts;thequestioniswhateachbidder discriminatory shouldpay. Inthepay-your-bidscheme(theso-calleddiscriminatorypricingrule) pricingrule each of the three top bidders pays a differentamount, namely, his own bid. This rulethereforegeneralizesthefirst-priceauction. Undertheuniformpricingruleall uniformpricing winners pay the same amount; this is usually eitherthe highestamong the losing rule bidsorthelowestamongthewinningbids. Second,insteadofplacingasinglebid,biddersgenerallyhavetoprovideaprice offerforeverynumberofunits. Ifabiddersimplynamesonenumberofunitsand all-or-nothing isunwillingtoacceptanyfewer,wesayhehasplacedanall-or-nothingbid. Ifhe bid namesonenumberofunits butwill acceptanysmallernumberatthe samepriceper-unitwe call the bid divisible. We investigatesome richerways for biddersto divisiblebid specifymultiunitvaluationstowardstheendofSection11.2.3. Finally, tie-breaking can be tricky when bidders place all-or-nothing bids. For example,consideranauctionfor10unitsinwhichthehighestbidsareasfollows, all of them all-or-nothing: 5 units for $20/unit, 3 units for $15/unit, 5 units for Freeforon-screenuse;pleasedonotdistribute.Youcangetanotherfreecopy ofthisPDFororderthebookathttp://www.masfoundations.org. 352 11 ProtocolsforMultiagentResourceAllocation:Auctions $15/unit, and 1 unit for $15/unit. Presumably, the first bid should be satisfied, as well as two of the remaining three—but which? Here one sees different tiebreaking rules—by quantity (larger bids win over smaller ones), by time (earlier bidswinoverlaterbids),andcombinationsthereof. Englishauctions When moving to the multiunit case, designers of English auctions face all of the problemsdiscussedabove.However,sincebidderscanrevisetheiroffersfromone round to the next, multiunit English auctions rarely ask bidders to specify more thanonenumberofunitsalongwith theirpriceoffer.
