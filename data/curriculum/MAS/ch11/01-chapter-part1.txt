11 Protocols for Multiagent Resource Allocation: Auctions In this chapter we consider the problem of allocating (discrete) resources among selfish agents in a multiagent system. Auctions—an interesting and important application of mechanism design—turn out to provide a general solution to this problem. Wedescribevariousdifferentflavorsofauctions,includingsingle-good, multiunit, and combinatorial auctions. In each case, we survey some of the key theoretical,practical,andcomputationalinsightsfromtheliterature. Theauctionsettingisimportantfortworeasons. First,auctionsarewidelyused in real life, in consumer, corporate, as well as government settings. Millions of people use auctions daily on Internet consumer Web sites to trade goods.

Indeed, since auctions are simply mechanisms(see Chapter 10) for allocating goods, there is an infinite numberofauctiontypes. Inthemostfamiliartypesofauctionsthereisonegoodfor sale, one seller, and multiple potential buyers. Each buyerhas his own valuation for the good, and each wishes to purchase it at the lowest possible price.

We endthe sectionby presentinga unifyingviewofauctionsas structured negotiations. Englishauctions Englishauction The English auction is perhaps the best-known family of auctions, since in one formoranothersuchauctionsareusedinthevenerable,old-guardauctionhouses, aswellasmostoftheonlineconsumerauctionsites. Theauctioneersetsastarting price for the good, and agents then have the option to announce successive bids, each of which must be higher than the previous bid (usually by some minimum increment set by the auctioneer). The rules for when the auction closes vary; in someinstancestheauctionendsatafixedtime,inothersitendsafterafixedperiod duringwhich no new bids are made, in othersat the latestof the two, andin still otherinstancesattheearliestofthetwo.

This auction gets its name from the fact that it is used in the Amsterdam flower market; in practice, it is most often used in settings where goods must be soldquickly. Sealed-bidauctions open-outcry All the auctions discussed so far are considered open-outcry auctions, in that all auction the biddingis doneby calling outthe bids in public (however,as we will discuss shortly, in the case of
