the drawback that they can suffer from a lack of liquidity: trades can occur only when agents want contractsonbothsidesofthemarketatthesametime. Liquiditycanbeintroduced by a market maker. However, such a market maker therefore assumes financial risk, which means the mechanism is not budget balanced. Another approach is a parimutuel market: bidders place money on different outcomes, and when the true outcome is observed, the winning bidders split the pot in proportion to the amounteach one gambled. These markets are budgetbalanced and do not suffer fromilliquidity;however,agentshavenoincentivetoplacebetsbeforethelastmoment,andsothemarketlosesthepropertyofaggregatingbeliefsinrealtime. Yet more complicated mechanisms, such as dynamic parimutuel markets and market scoring rules, are able to achieve real-time belief aggregation, bound the marketmaker’sworst-caseloss, andstill providesubstantialliquidity.

Earlier surveysinclude Cassady [1967], Wilson [1987a], and McAfee and MacMillan [1987]. These texts cover most of the canonicalsingle-good and multi-unit auction types we discuss in the chapter. (One exceptionis theeliminationauction, whichwe gaveas anexample ofthediversityofauctiontypes;itwasintroducedbyFujishimaetal. [1999b].) Vickrey’sseminalcontribution[Vickrey,1961]isstillrecommendedreadingfor anyone interested in auctions. In it Vickrey introduced the second-price auction andarguedthatbiddersinsuchanauctiondobestwhentheybidsincerely. Healso providedtheanalysisofthefirst-priceauctionundertheindependentprivatevalue modelwith the uniform distribution described in the chapter. He even proved an early version of the revenue-equivalencetheorem (Theorem 11.1.4), namely that in the independentprivate value case, the English, Dutch, first-price, and secondpriceauctionsallproducethe same expectedrevenueforthe seller. Forhis work, VickreyreceivedaNobelPrizein1996. Themoregeneralformoftherevenue-equivalencetheorem,Theorem11.1.4,is due to Myerson [1981] and Riley and Samuelson [1981], who also investigated optimal (i.e., revenue-maximizing) auctions. Our proof of the theorem follows Klemperer [1999a]. The “auctions as structured negotiations” point of view was advancedbyWurmanetal. [2001]. McAfeeandMcMillan[1987]introducedthe notionofauctionswithanuncertainnumberofbidders,andHarstadetal. [1990] analyzeditsequilibrium. Theso-calledWilsondoctrinewasarticulatedinWilson [1987b].Theresultthatoneadditionalbidderyieldsmorerevenuethananoptimal reserve price is due to Bulow and Klemperer [1996]. The most influential theoreticalstudiesofcollusionwerebyGrahamandMarshall[1987]forsecond-price auctions and McAfee and McMillan [1992] for first-price auctions.

Milgrom[1981]analyzedthesymmetricequilibriumforsecond-priceauctionsunder commonvalues.TheaffiliatedvaluemodelwasintroducedbyMilgromandWeber [1982].
