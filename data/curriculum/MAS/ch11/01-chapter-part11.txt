for domains in which the agents’ valuations are unrelated to each other, depending only on their own signals—for example, because an agent is buying a good for his own personal use. In this section, we discuss differentmodels, in which agents’valuationsdependon both theirownsignalsandotheragents’signals. Commonvalues commonvalue First ofall, we discuss the commonvalue (CV) setting, in which all agentsvalue the good at exactly the same amount. The twist is that the agents do not know thisamount,thoughtheyhave(common)priorbeliefsaboutitsdistribution.

The catch is i that, since the value of the good to each bidderis the same, each bidder cares as much about other bidders’ signals as he does about his own.

Ofcourse,thewinner’scursedoesnotmeanthatintheCVsettingthewinnerof a second-priceauction always pays too much. Instead, it goes to show that truth telling is no longer a dominant strategy (or, indeed, an equilibrium strategy) of the second-priceauctionin this setting. There is still an equilibrium strategythat bidderscanfollow in orderto achievepositiveexpectedutility from participating intheauction;thissimplyrequiresthebidderstoconsiderhowtheywouldupdate theirbeliefsonfindingthattheywerethehighbidder.
