such as eBay. Under proxy bidding, a bidder tells the system the maximum amount he is willing to pay. The user can then leave the site, and the systembidsasthebidder’sproxy: everytimethebidderisoutbid,thesystemwill respond with a bid one increment higher, until the bidder’s maximum is reached. It is easy to see that if all bidders use the proxy service and update it only once, whatoccurswillbeidenticaltoasecond-priceauction(exceptingthatthewinner’s paymentmaybeonebidincrementhigher). ThemaincomplicationwithEnglishauctionsisthatbidderscanplaceso-called jumpbids: bidsthataregreaterthantheprevioushighbidbymorethanthe minimumincrement. Althoughitseemsrelativelyinnocuous,this featurecomplicates analysis of such auctions. Indeed, when an ascending auction is analyzed it is almostalwaystheJapanesevariant,nottheEnglish. 11.1.4 First-priceandDutchauctions Letusnowconsiderfirst-priceauctions.

Of course, all this talk of equivalencedoes not help us to understand anything about how an agent should actually bid in a first-price or Dutch auction. Unfortunately,unlikethecaseofsecond-priceauctions,herewe donothavetheluxury of dominant strategies, and must thus resort to Bayes–Nash equilibrium analysis.
