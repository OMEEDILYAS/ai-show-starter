Combinatorialauctions 361 This example suggests a connection between the GSP and the VCG mechanism. However, these two mechanisms are actually quite different, as becomes clearwhenweapplytheVCGformulatothepositionauctionsetting.

Indeed, truthful bidding is not always a good idea under the GSP. Consider the samebiddersasin ourrunningexample,butchangethe click-throughrate ofslot 2 to α = 0.4. When all bidders bid truthfully we have already shown that bid2 der 1 would achieve expectedutility of $3 (this argumentdid not dependon α ). 2 However,ifbidder1changedhis bidto $3, he wouldbeawardedthe secondslot andwouldachieveexpectedutilityof0.4($10 $2) = $3.2.

(Indeed,wehavebeenmakingthis assumptionalmostcontinuously noexternalities since introducing quasilinear utilities in the previous chapter; however, this is a goodtimetoremindthereaderofit.) Specifically,wehaveassertedthatabidder’s valuation depends only on the set of goods he wins. This assumption is quite standard;however,itdoesnotallowustomodelabidderwhoalsocaresaboutthe allocationsandpaymentsoftheotheragents. We will usually be interested in settings where bidders have nonadditive valunonadditive ation functions, for example valuing bundles of goods more than the sum of the valuation values for single goods. We identify two important kinds of nonadditivity. First, functions whentwoitemsarepartialsubstitutesforeachother(e.g.,aSonyTVandaToshiba TV, or, more partially, a CD player and an MP3 player), their combined value is partial substitutes less than the sum of their individual values. Strengthening this condition, when two items are strict substitutes their combined value is the same as the value for strictsubstitutes eitheroneofthegoods.Forexample,considertwonontransferableticketsforseats onthesameplane.
