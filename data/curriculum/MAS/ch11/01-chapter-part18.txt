when faced with such bidders? One approach is simply to sell the goods individually, ignoring the bidders’ valuations. This is easyfor the seller, butit makesthings difficult forthe bidders. In particuexposure lar,itpresentsthemwith whatiscalledtheexposureproblem: abiddermightbid problem aggressively for a set of goods in the hopes of winning a bundle, but succeed in winning only a subsetof the goods and therefore pay too much.

Despite some successes in practice, however, this approach has auction thedrawbackthatitonlymitigatestheexposureproblemratherthaneliminatingit entirely. A third approach ties goods together in a more straightforward way: the auctioneer sells all goods in a single auction, and allows bidders to bid directly on combinatorial bundles of goods. Such mechanisms are called combinatorial auctions. This apauction proacheliminatestheexposureproblembecausebiddersareguaranteedthattheir bids will be satisfied “all or nothing.” For examplea biddermay be permitted to offer $100 for the pair (TV, DVD player), or to make a disjunctive offer “either $100forTV1or$90forTV2,butnotboth.” However,wewillseethatwhilecombinatorialauctionsresolvethe exposureproblemthey raise manyotherquestions.

As in the multiunit case, VCG has some attractive properties when applied to combinatorialauctions. Specifically, it is dominant-strategytruthful, efficient, ex postindividualrationalandweaklybudgetbalanced(thelatterbyTheorems10.4.8 and10.4.10). TheVCGcombinatorialauctionmechanismisnotwithoutshortcomings,however,aswealreadydiscussedinSection 10.4.5.
