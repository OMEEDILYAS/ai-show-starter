Some of the historical references are as follows. The earliest game-theoreticpublicationisarguablythatofZermelo,whoin1913introducedthe notionsofa gametree andbackwardinductionandarguedthatin principlechess admits a trivial solution [Zermelo, 1913]. It was already mentionedin Chapter3 thatextensive-formgameswerediscussedexplicitlyinvonNeumannandMorgenstern [1944], as was backwardinduction. Subgameperfectionwas introducedby Selten [1965], who received a Nobel Prize in 1994. The material on computing all subgame-perfect equilibria is based on Littman et al. [2006]. The Centipede gamewasintroducedbyRosenthal[1981];manyotherpapersdiscusstherationalityofbackwardinductioninsuchgames[Aumann,1995;Binmore,1996;Aumann, 1996]. In 1953 Kuhn introduced extensive-form games of imperfect information, including the distinction and connection between mixed and behavioral strategies [Kuhn,1953].

The use of the sequence form for computing the equilibria of general-sum two-player games of imperfect information is explained by Koller et al. [1996]. Sequential equilibria wereintroducedbyKrepsandWilson[1982]. Here,asinnormal-formgames,the full list of alternative solution concepts and connection among them is long, and the interested readeris referred to Hillas and Kohlberg [2002]and Govindanand Wilson[2005b]foramoreextensivesurveythanispossiblehere.
