To begin with, what is a sequence? The keyinsightofthe sequenceform is that, while thereare exponentiallymanypure strategies in an extensive-form game, there are only a small number of nodes in the game tree. Rather than building a player’s strategy around the idea of pure strategies, the sequence form builds it around paths in the tree from the root to eachnode. sequence Definition5.2.6(Sequence) Asequenceofactionsofplayeri N,definedbya ∈ nodeh H Z ofthegametree,istheorderedsetofplayeri’sactionsthatlie ∈ ∪ onthepathfromtheroottoh.

Considerthegame given in Figure 5.10 (see p. 131). The sets of sequences for the two players are Σ = ,L,R,Lℓ,Lr andΣ = ,A,B . ThepayofffunctionisgiveninFig1 2 {∅ } {∅ } ure5.13.

Wenowhaveasetofplayers,asetofsequences,andamappingfromsequences to payoffs. At first glance this may look like everythingwe need to describe our game. However, sequences do not quite take the place of actions. In particular, a playercannotsimply select a single sequencein the way that he would selecta purestrategy—theotherplayer(s)mightnotplayinawaythatwouldallowhimto followit to its end.
