The definition of best response and Nash equilibria in this game are exactly as they are for normal-form games.

In this way, for every perfect-information game there exists a corresponding normal-form game. Note, however, that the temporal structure of the extensiveformrepresentationcanresultinacertainredundancywithinthenormalform. For example, in Figure 5.3 there are 16 different outcomes, while in Figure 5.2 there areonly5 (the payoff(3,8) occursonlyoncein Figure 5.2butfourtimes in FigUncorrectedmanuscriptofMultiagentSystems,publishedbyCambridgeUniversityPress Revision1.1©Shoham&Leyton-Brown,2009,2010. 5.1 Perfect-informationextensive-formgames 121 ure 5.3, etc.).

This isanimportantlesson,sincethedidacticexamplesofnormal-formgamesarevery small,wronglysuggestingthatthisformismorecompact. The normal form gets its revenge, however, since the reverse transformation— fromthenormalformtotheperfect-informationextensiveform—doesnotalways exist.

Theexcuse(which alsoallowsthepostponement,thoughnotforlong)isthefollowingtheorem. Theorem5.1.3 Every (finite) perfect-information game in extensive form has a pure-strategyNashequilibrium. This is perhaps the earliest result in game theory, due to Zermelo in 1913 (see the historical notes at the end of the chapter). The intuition here should be clear; sinceplayerstaketurns,andeveryonegetstoseeeverythingthathappenedthusfar before making a move, it is never necessary to introduce randomness into action selectioninordertofindanequilibrium. Wewillseethisplainlywhenwediscuss backward backwardinductionbelow. Both this intuitionandthe theoremwillceaseto hold induction when we discuss more general classes of games such as imperfect-information games in extensive form. First, however, we discuss an important refinement of theconceptofNashequilibrium. 5.1.3 Subgame-perfectequilibrium Aswehavediscussed,thenotionofNashequilibriumisaswelldefinedinperfectinformation games in extensive form as it is in the normal form. However, as the following exampleshows, the Nash equilibrium can be too weak a notion for the extensive form. Consider again the perfect-information extensive-form game shown in Figure 5.2. There are three pure-strategy Nash equilibria in this game: (A,G),(C,F) , (A,H),(C,F) , and (B,H),(C,E) . This can be deter- { } { } { } minedbyexaminingthenormalformimageofthegame,asindicatedinFigure5.4. However, examining the normal form image of an extensive-form game obscures the game’s temporal nature. To illustrate a problem that can arise in certain equilibria of extensive-form games, in Figure 5.5 we contrast the equilibria Freeforon-screenuse;pleasedonotdistribute.Youcangetanotherfreecopy ofthisPDFororderthebookathttp://www.masfoundations.org. 122 5 GameswithSequentialActions:ReasoningandComputingwiththeExtensiveForm (C,E) (C,F) (D,E) (D,F) (A,G) 3,8 3,8 8,3 8,3 (A,H) 3,8 3,8 8,3 8,3 (B,G) 5,5 2,10 5,5 2,10 (B,H) 5,5 1,0 5,5 1,0 Figure5.4: EquilibriaofthegamefromFigure5.2.
