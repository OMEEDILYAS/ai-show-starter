For a decision node h for player i that is in information set i I I , and for any sequence (seq (I)a ) Ext (I), β (h,a ) is defined as ∈ i i i ∈ i i i ri(seq i (I)ai), as long as r (seq (I)) > 0.

Let i C = (C ,...,C ). We have now defined all the elements5 of a sequence-form 1 n representationG = (N,Σ,g,C),aslaidoutinDefinition5.2.5. Whatis the space complexityofthe sequence-formrepresentation? Unlike the normal form, the size of this representation is linear in the size of the extensiveform game. There is one sequence for each node in the game tree, plus the ∅ sequenceforeachplayer. As arguedpreviously,the payofffunctiong canberepresented sparsely, so that each payoff correspondingto a leaf node is stored only 5.
