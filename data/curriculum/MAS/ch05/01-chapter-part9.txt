What we want is for agents to select behavioral strategies. (Since we have assumed that our game G has perfect recall, Theorem 5.2.4 tells us that any equilibriumwillbeexpressibleusingbehavioralstrategies.) However,itturnsoutthat it is not a good idea to work with behavioral strategies directly—if we did so, the optimization problems we develop later would be computationally harder to solve. Instead, we will developthe alternate conceptofa realization plan, which corresponds to the probability that a given sequence would arise under a given behavioralstrategy. Consider an agent i following a behavioral strategy that assigned probability β (h,a )to takingactiona ata givendecisionnodeh. Thenwe canconstructa i i i realization plan that assigns probabilities to sequences in a way that recovers i’s behavioralstrategyβ. realizationplan Definition5.2.8(Realizationplanofβ ) Therealizationplanofβ forplayeri i i ∈ ofβ i N is a mapping r i : Σ i 7→ [0,1] definedas r i (σ i ) = c∈σi β i (c).

Thereisasecond,equivalentdefinitionwiththeadvantagethatitinvolvesasetof linear equations, although it is a bit more complicated. This definition relies on twofunctionsthatwewillmakeextensiveuseofinthissection. To define the first function, we make use of our assumption that G is a game ofperfectrecall. Thisentails that, givenaninformationsetI I , theremustbe i ∈ one single sequence that player i can play to reach all of his nonterminal choice nodes h I. We denote this mapping as seq : I Σ , and call seq (I) the ∈ i i 7→ i i seq (I):the sequenceleadingtoinformationsetI.

By σ a denoteasequencethatconsistsofthe sequenceσ followedby i i i thesingleactiona . Aslongas thenewsequencestill belongsto Σ , we saythat i i the sequence σ a extends the sequence σ . A sequence can often be extended i i i in multiple ways—for example, perhaps agent i could have chosen an action a′ i Exti(σ i): instead of a i after playing sequenceσ i . We denote by Ext i : Σ i 2Σi a func7→ sequences tion mapping from sequences to sets of sequences, where Ext (σ ) denotes the i i extendingσ i set of sequencesthat extendthe sequenceσ . We define Ext ( ) to be the set of i i ∅ all single-action sequences. Note that extensionalways refers to playing a single action beyond a given sequence; thus, σ a a′ does not belong to Ext (σ ), even i i i i i ifit is avalid sequence. (Itdoesbelongto Ext (σ a ).)
