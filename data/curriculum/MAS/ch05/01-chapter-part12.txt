Notethatincontrast,themethodsdescribedinSection4.1wouldrequiretimeexponentialinthesizeoftheextensiveform,because theyrequireconstructionofanLPwithaconstraintforeachpurestrategyofeach playerandavariableforeachpurestrategyofoneoftheplayers. This new linear program for games in sequence form can be constructed quite directly from the dual LP given in Equations (5.8)–(5.9). Intuitively, we simply treat the terms r () as variables ratherthan constants, and add in the constraints 2 · from Definition 5.2.9 to ensure that r is a valid realization plan. The program 2 follows. minimize v (5.10) 0 subjectto v I1(σ1) − v I′ ≥ g 1 (σ 1 ,σ 2 )r 2 (σ 2 ) ∀σ 1 ∈Σ 1 (5.11) I′∈I1(XExt1(σ1)) σ2X ∈Σ2 r (∅)=1 (5.12) 2 r (σ′ )=r (seq (I)) ∀I ∈I (5.13) 2 2 2 2 2 σ 2 ′∈ XExt2(I) r (σ )≥0 ∀σ ∈Σ (5.14) 2 2 2 2 Thefactthatr isnowavariablemeansthatplayer2’srealizationplanwillnow 2 be selected to minimize player 1’s expected utility when player 1 best responds to it. In other words, we find a minmax strategy for player 2 against player 1, and since we have a two-player zero-sum game it is also a Nash equilibrium by Theorem 3.4.4. Observe that if we had tried this same trick with the primal LP giveninEquations(5.4)–(5.7)wewouldhaveendedupwithaquadraticobjective function,andhencenotalinearprogram.
