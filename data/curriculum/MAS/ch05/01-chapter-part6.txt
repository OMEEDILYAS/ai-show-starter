In this gametwo playersalternatein makingdecisions,ateach turnchoosingbetweengoing“down”andendingthe gameorgoing“across”and continuing it (except at the last node where going “across” also ends the game). The payoffsareconstructedin sucha way thatthe onlySPE is foreachplayerto always choose to go down. To see why, consider the last choice. Clearly at that point the best choice for the player is to go down. Since this is the case, going downis also the bestchoiceforthe otherplayerin the previouschoicepoint.

This would seem to be the end ofthis story, exceptfor two peskyfactors. The first problem is that the SPE prediction in this case flies in the face of intuition. Indeed, in laboratory experiments subjects in fact continue to play “across” until closetotheendofthegame. Thesecondproblemistheoretical.

Forthisreasonwehavecalledtheseperfect-information games. Wemightnotalwayswanttomakesuchastrongassumptionaboutourplayers and our environment. In many situations we may want to model agents needing to actwith partialorno knowledgeofthe actions takenby others, or evenagents withlimitedmemoryoftheirownpastactions. Thesequencingofchoicesallows us to represent such ignorance to a limited degree; an “earlier” choice might be interpretedasachoicemadewithoutknowingthe“later”choices.

Fromthetechnical point ofview, imperfect-information games areobtained byoverlaying apartition structure, as defined in Chapter 13 inconnection with models of knowledge, over a perfect-information game.

In this game, player 1 has two information sets: the set including the top choice node, and the set including the bottom choice nodes. Note that the two bottom choice nodes in the second information set have the same set of possible actions. We can regard player 1 as not knowing whether player 2 chose A or B when he makeshischoicebetweenℓandr. 5.2.2 Strategiesandequilibria A pure strategy for
