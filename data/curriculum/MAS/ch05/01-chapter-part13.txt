The question is whether this essential idea can be appliedtothebroaderclassofimperfect-informationgames;itturnsoutthatitcan, althoughthedetailsareconsiderablymoreinvolved.

One of the more influential nosequential tionshasbeenthatofsequentialequilibrium(SE).Itsharessomefeatureswiththe equilibrium notionoftrembling-handperfection,discussedin Section 3.4.6.

Considerforthe momentafullymixed-strategyprofile.7 Suchastrategyprofileinducesapositive probability on every node in the game tree. This means in particular that every informationsetis givenapositiveprobability. Therefore,foragivenfullymixedstrategy profile, one can meaningfully speak of i’s expected utility, given that he findshimselfinanyparticularinformationset. (Theexpectedutilityofstartingat any node is well defined, and since each node is given positive probability, one can apply Bayes’rule to aggregatethe expectedutilities of the differentnodes in theinformationset.)

Theexpected utility of starting in information sets whose probability is zero under the given strategy profile is simply not well defined. This is where the ingenious deviceof SE comes in. Given anystrategy profile s (not necessarilyfully mixed), imagine a probability distribution µ(h) over each information set. µ has to be consistent with s, in the sensethatforsets whoseprobabilityis nonzeroundertheirparents’ conditional distribution s, this distribution is precisely the one defined by Bayes’ rule.
