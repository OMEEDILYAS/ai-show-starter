classical notation for a modal operator is 2, often pronounced “necessarily” (and thus 2ϕ is read as “ϕ is necessarily true”).

Thedefaulttypeofjudgment,capturedinclassical logicandnotrequiringanexplicitmodaloperator,is whetherthesentenceis true or false. But one might want to capture other sorts of judgments. The original motivationwithin philosophyforintroducingthemodaloperatoris to distinguish between different “strengths of truth." In particular, the wish was to distinguish between accidentaltruths such as “it is sunnyin Palo Alto” (represented, say, by thepropositionalsymbolp),necessarytruthssuchas“eitheritissunnyinPaloAlto Freeforon-screenuse;pleasedonotdistribute.Youcangetanotherfreecopy ofthisPDFororderthebookathttp://www.masfoundations.org. 414 13 LogicsofKnowledgeandBelief oritisnot”(2(p p)),andpossibletruthsascapturedby“itmaybesunnyinPalo Alto"(3p).

Logics of knowledgeand belief read 2 yet differently, as “ϕ is known” or “ϕ is believed.” These inherently relate the sentence to an agent, who is doing the knowing or believing.
