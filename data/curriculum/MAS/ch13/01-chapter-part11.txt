salvage the situation by implementing a later termination condition. This idea obviously fails, because if robot 2 instead waits for R to 2 be a value greater than 3, then robot 1 may have already stopped. However, our problems run deeper. Even if we only require that the robots coordinate at some time after robot 1 enters the goal area (implicitly extending the goal to the range UncorrectedmanuscriptofMultiagentSystems,publishedbyCambridgeUniversityPress Revision1.1©Shoham&Leyton-Brown,2009,2010. 13.6 Fromknowledgetobelief 429 [2, ]), wecanneverfindasoundandcompleteterminationcondition.

Inthissectionwediscuss“belief,”andinthenextsectionwe willmentionathird—“certainty.” Like knowledge, belief is a mental attitude, and concerns an agent’s view of differentstateofaffairs. Indeed,wewillmodelbeliefusingKripkestructures(i.e., possibleworldswithbinaryrelationsdefinedonthem). However,intuitiontellsus that belief has different properties from those of knowledge, which suggests that these Kripke structures should be different from the partition models capturing knowledge. We will return to the semantic modelof belief shortly, but it is perhaps easiest to makethetransition fromknowledgeto beliefvia theaxiomaticsystem. Recall thatinthecaseofknowledgewehadtheveridityaxiom,T: K ϕ ϕ. Suppose i → we take the S5 system and simply drop this axiom—whatdo we get? Hidden in thissimplequestionisasubtlety,itturnsout. RecallthatS5wasshorthandforthe system KDT45. Recall also that KDT45 was logically equivalent to KT45. However, KD45 is not logically equivalent to K45; axiom D is not derivable without axiom T (why?). It turns out that both KD45 and K45 have been put forwardas a logic ofidealized belief, andin factboth havebeencalled weak S5.
