Ofcourse,thejointnatureofthecomputationmeansthat theprocessorsneedtocommunicatewithoneanother. Onesetofproblemscomes aboutwhenthecommunicationiserror-prone. Inthiscasethesystemanalystmay find himself saying somethinglike the following: “ProcessorA sentthe message toprocessorB.Themessagemaynotarrive,andprocessorAknowsthis. Furthermore, this is common knowledge, so processorA knows that processorB knows that it (A) knows that if a message was sent it may not arrive.” The topic of this chapterishowtomakesuchreasoningprecise. 13.1.1 Muddychildrenandwarringgenerals Oftenthemodelingisdoneinthecontextofsomestylizedproblem,withanassociatedentertainingstory. Thus,forexample,whenwereturntothedistributedcomputing application in Section 13.4, rather than speak about computer processors, wewilltellthestoryoftwogeneralswhoattempttocoordinateamongthemselves toganguponathird. Fornow,however,considerthefollowinglessviolentstory. A group of n children enters their house after having played in the mud outside. They are greeted in the hallway by their father, who noticesthatkofthechildrenhavemudontheirforeheads.Hemakes the following announcement, “At least one of you has mud on his forehead.” The children can all see each other’s foreheads, but not theirown. Thefatherthensays,“Doanyofyouknowthatyouhave mud on your forehead? If you do, raise your hand now.” No one 410 13 LogicsofKnowledgeandBelief raises his hand. The father repeats the question, and again no one moves. Thefatherdoesnotgiveupandkeepsrepeatingthequestion. After exactly k rounds, all the children with muddy foreheads raise theirhandssimultaneously. How can this be? On the face of it only the father’s initial statementconveyed new information to the children, and his subsequent questions add nothing. If a childdidnothaveinformationatthebeginning,howcouldhelateron? Hereisaninformalargument. Letusstartwiththesimplecaseinwhichk = 1. In this case the single muddy child knows that all the others are clean, and when thefatherannouncesthatatleastonechildisdirtyhecanconcludethathehimself is that child. Note that none of the other children know at this point whether or nottheyaremuddy. (Afterthemuddychildraiseshishand,however,theydo;see next.) Nowconsiderk = 2. Imaginethatyouareoneofthetwomuddychildren. Afterthefather’sfirstannouncement,youlookaroundtheroomandseethatthere isamuddychildotherthanyou. Thusafterthefather’sannouncementyoudonot have enough information to know whether you are muddy (you might be, but it couldalso be thatthe otherchild is the only muddyone). Butyou notethat after thefather’sfirstquestiontheothermuddychilddoesnotraisehishand. Youthen realizethatyouyourselfmustbemuddyaswell, orelse—basedonthereasoning inthek = 1case—thatchildwouldhaveraisedhishand. Soyouraiseyourhand. Ofcourse,sodoestheothermuddychild. You could extendthis argumentto k = 3,4,..., showingin each case that all ofthekmuddychildrenraisetheirhandstogetherafterthekthtimethatthefather asks the question. But of course, you would rather have a general theorem that applies to all k. In particular, you might want to prove by induction that after rounds1,2,...,k 1,noneofthechildrenknowwhethertheyaredirty,butafter − the next round exactly the muddy children do. However, for this we will need a formalmodelof“know”thatappliesinthisexample. 13.1.2 Formalizingintuitionsaboutthepartition model partitionmodel Definition13.1.1(Partitionmodel) An(n-agent)partitionmodeloveralanguage ΣisatupleA =(W,π,I ,...,I ),where 1 n • W isasetofpossibleworlds; • π : Σ 2W isaninterpretationfunctionthatdetermineswhichsentencesin 7→ thelanguagesaretrueinwhichworlds;and • each I denotes a set of possible worlds that are equivalentfrom the point of i viewofagenti.
