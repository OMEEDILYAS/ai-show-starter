whichthe accessibility relations are serial, transitive, and Euclidean. Just as in the case of knowledge, there is a relatively simple way to understand this class, although it is not as simple as the class of partitions. As shown in Figure 13.8, we can envisionsuch a structure as composed of several clusters of worlds, each of which is completely connected internally. In additionthere are possiblysomesingleton worlds, eachofwhich is connectedonlytoalltheworldswithinexactlyonecluster.

But of course we may well want to combine the two, so thatwecanformalizesentencessuchas“ifBobknowsthatAlicebelievesitisraining,thenAliceknowsthatBobknowsit.” Indeed,itiseasyenoughto justmerge thelanguagesofknowledgeandbelief,soastoallowthesentence: K B rain K K B rain. B A A B A → Furthermore, there is no difficulty in merging the semantic structures and having twosetsofaccessibilityrelationsoverthepossibleworlds—partitionmodelsrepresentingthe knowledgeofthe agentsandquasi-partitionmodelsrepresentingtheir beliefs. Finally, we can merge the axiom systems of knowledge and belief and obtainasoundandcompleteaxiomatizationofmergedstructures.

It will force us, however, to reconsidersomeoftheassumptionswehavemadeaboutknowledgeandbeliefthusfar, andtoenterintophilosophicaldiscussionmoredeeplythanwehaveheretofore. To begin, we should distinguish two types of belief. Both of them are distindefeasible guishedfrom knowledgein that they are defeasible; the agentmay believesomethingfalse.

IfyouweretoaskJohn,hewould tellyouthatthebankis open. Ifyoupressedhimwith“Areyousure?” hewould answer“Whatdoyoumean‘amIsure,’Iknowthatitisopen.” Butofcoursethis cannot be knowledge, since it is false. In contrast, you can imagine that John is pretty sure that the bank is open, sufficiently so to make substantial plans based on this belief. In this case if you were to ask John “Is the bank open?” he might answer “I believe so, but I am not sure.” In this case John would be the first to admitthatthisisamerebeliefonhispart,notknowledge.5 From a technicalpoint of view, we can split the B operatorinto two versions, i Bm for “mere belief” and Bc for certainty. Even before entering into a formal i i account of such operators, we expect that the sentence Bcϕ BcK ϕ will be i → i i valid,butthesentenceBmϕ BmK ϕwillnot. i → i i Thisdistinctionbetweencertaintyandmerebeliefalsocallsintoquestionsome ofourassumptionsaboutknowledge,inparticularthenegativeintrospectionproperty. Considerthe following informalargument. SupposeJohn is certain thatthe bankinopen(Bcopen). Accordingtoourinterpretationofcertainty,wehavethat J Johniscertainthatheknowsthatthebankisopen(BcK open). Supposethatthe J J bankisinfactclosed( open). ThismeansthatJohndoesnotknowthatthebank ¬ is closed, because of the veridity property ( K open). Because of the negative J ¬ introspection property, we can conclude that John knows that he does not know that the bank is open (K K open). If we reasonably assume that knowledge J J ¬ implies certainty, we also get that John is certain that he does
